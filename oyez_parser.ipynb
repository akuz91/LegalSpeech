       "' <Earl Warren>  Number 14, Original, State of Louisiana, Plaintiff, versus the State of Mississippi. Mr. Madden, you may proceed with your arguments. <John L. Madden>  Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of this Honorable Court. A first few words that I shall say will -- I will -- ameliorating to this Court, because I said substantially the same thing I gave before standing before this Court when I had the privilege of doing so I introduced the argument in this manner, my recollection of how we came into this Court and why. And we have a new justice on the Supreme Court in the meantime. And I\\'ll just simply say that this controversy had its inception in a suit that was filed by certain Mississippi landowners and a District Court of the United States in Mississippi. It was directed solely against Humble Oil and Refining Company, Louisiana\\'s mineral lessee. The Mississippi landowners alleged in their complaint, as they were the owners of an oil well which was drilled by Carter Oil Company which merged with Humble Oil on December the 1st, 1959. Under its lease from the drill site in Louisiana to an oil producing zone and bottomed in the bed of the Mississippi River. Plaintiffs, Mr. Carrols and Carrols (ph) family claimed that the oil well was producing within the State of Mississippi from lands which they had come to own by a reason now were shift in the main channel of the Mississippi River. The title to Louisiana\\'s property having been attacked in that suit, Louisiana filed a motion, this Honorable Court believed to file a complaint and all that the court did before this Court, the only tribunal that could pass on all of the issues. And we made as defendants, the State of Mississippi, the Mississippi landowners now lessees on them giving everyone the right to come in and be heard subject to granting the pleading granted by this Court. The United States district judge issued an order staying the proceedings in the Federal District Court with all of the necessary parties both public and private being before this Court after leave was granted to file a complaint, this Court in our -- in its order that we interpreted it, accept the jurisdiction for all purposes. The Special Master then conducted hearings, took evidence and heard all authorities, both private and public wishing to be heard. He has filed his report and we are here on exceptions to that report. It is my purpose to state the facts in this original action, particularly all of the controlling facts on which Louisiana predicates its exceptions to the Special Master report, the effects in this case dominate because they are unprecedented in boundary actions heretofore decided by this Honorable Court. My Associate Counsel, Mr. Carmouche shall follow me to discuss the existing jurisprudence and the legal phases of the Court. It is appropriate to say at the start that Louisiana concurs fully in all of the truly important parts of the Special Master\\'s findings of fact. In his illuminating résumé of facts highlighting his report, the Special Master lightens the Mississippi River to assert between Carlyle, Illinois and the Gulf of Mexico, referring of course to the continuous bends or loops near the river extending ultimately from east to west throughout the descent of the river and in widening its way to the Gulf of Mexico. The expert witnesses at the hearings conducted by the Special Master, agreed that the deepest part of the river by the channel is in the concave portion of the -- where the force of the river strikes hard against the bank causing erosion and caving. While across the river, in the convex area, where the water is shallow accretion is formed to the bank. They explained that the river in the concave area crosses over to the next bend in the concave area and then again following its course downstream. Now material from the concave bank is deposited on the next convex bank. Caving is the result of the direction of a channel against the concave bank where the deepest portion of the river is found. Scouring may take place in the deeper portion of the river where there are high velocities. If the banks are composed of homogenous material, the expert say that bends are rather uniform. However, resistant material such as clay or clay deposits when encountered by river action form a bank called a false keep or hard point. And where there are such tough or resistant soil have been developed slowly and is partly controlled in configuration by that soil. Clay pugs are characterized as cohesive hanging together forming a resistant mass to any channel obscuring action of the river, and are quite thick. The experts reported crossings in the river as extending to relatively straight regions. They are located almost invariably up and downstream on the -- in the river. And in those places where the navigator goes from one deep area to another and in that is a crossing and in that crossing the water is much shallower than it is in the deeper portion. <Earl Warren>  We\\'ll recess now Mr.-- <John L. Madden>  -- made reference to crossings to the area where the navigator goes from one deep water area that follows a bend over to the next concave bank. And in this crossing area, we have brought out that that the water is generally shallow in there. Now the only purpose of that is to show the Court the difference between your conclave and your convex bank and then you cross from one area to the other. Now in that crossing, of course the water is shallow. You\\'re not following the deepest water because the deepest water is where you\\'re trying to reach. Now proceeding from that point, I would like to say that throughout the expert testimony, exceeding stress was placed on the high importance of clay deposits found in the banks of meandering streams. The experts explained this tough material not only slows down the formation and development of bends, it has in affect on the configuration, it may elongate -- negate it, they won\\'t be uniform bends. At the -- then it also appreciatively affects the control of the direction of the channel flow. It is of exceeding importance, may it please the Court it will bear this clay plug as resistant soil in mine as I further reveal the facts in the case. And we are going to cling as close as we can to the language of the Special Master in this matter and that\\'s why -- course of the remaining portion of my part of the argument shall be in quotation from that because I want to link it in with the certain conclusions we reach to the end. On pages 6 and 7, there is a report, the Special Master says that, “At flood time, this bends, those meandering loops, grow even larger by the accelerated river action. Increase the overall length of the river where the corresponding decrease in the speed of the flow. And the greatest slope can be obtained by a cutoff across the neck thus increasing the rapidity of the river. The slowing down of the flow is a direct cause of flooding.” “And so attempts,” the Special Master says, \"Have been made to alleviate this by constructing cutoff or bypass bends.\" The Special Master requires of course to the action taken by the Mississippi River Commission under the guidance and the engineer in experience of the United State Corps of Engineer. In 19 -- in the late 1920s and the early 19 -- other in the 1930s, in their effort to improve flood control and navigation on the Mississippi River by the constructions of these cutoffs, that plan called for the construction of 15 cutoffs and those cutoffs have been constructed. Between Memphis, Tennessee and about 20 miles south of Natchez, Mississippi in what is referred to as the Deer Park area. This is getting in a proximity here of the cut that we\\'re speaking of and it includes this Glasscock Cutoff. It was one of the areas, one of the longest. Deer -- now, I\\'m going to ask to draw the Court\\'s attention to the diagram that it appears here. I regret, apologize to the Court that this is not larger in the larger lettering. But we have a little bit hard to anticipate just to the division from the sides. But we have a lettering on here and I don\\'t know whether they can be seen from the bench or not, but here is a letter Y, it runs around to a letter H and then to J and to A, B, C, X, Z and on this side B to X. Now, there is a Y -- <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Yes sir, may it please the Court. That\\'s on page 7, I believe -- <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Yes sir. Now there\\'s a -- <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Yes. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  That -- <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  This is approximately the same draft, similar to a draft. And this was placed in the brief for a different point altogether in what I\\'m discussing now. And this was placed in the brief to show some kind of balancing effect of the river action and the compensating effect brought about by the cut. The -- <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Yes. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Yes sir. Now the Missi -- <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Yes sir. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  That\\'s correct. Now, you have -- <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Yes sir. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Now, you have a wide sweep of the Mississippi River or you did have. Beginning at the point Y here, going over on the Louisiana side and it came on down here to the point and then went on out over here out of point X, the way I argue -- I followed it with my ruler. Now -- <UNK>  If we follow that would the oil well be in the Louisiana? <John L. Madden>  Yes sir. Now, such -- you have this wide sweep and then it\\'s kind of balanced downstream by the smallest sweep to the west toward Mississippi which is the Dead Mans Bend. Now, those two bends have been moving in opposite directions since the first recorded surveys of this area in 1860 -- in 1765. Now the United States Engineers decided to construct a 4-mile trench, running from the point of mark Y to point of B, that\\'s a distance of approximately 4 miles and that is what is called Glasscock Cutoff. Now -- and that bypass is generally referred to and it\\'s correctly they describe as the Glasscock Cutoff which goes from Y to B. And this B is the intersection line here -- is the line -- is the point where the old bend of Deer Park bend comes through here, point A and then continues in the stretch of the thalweg prior to the cutoff. It goes around and sweeps to the east and goes from point B to C and then C to X. Now, the vast changes that took place in connection with the cutoff weren\\'t completely visible. The drag in by the engineers was clearly perceptible, so where with the tons and tons of material that was dredged out in deposits on the then existing banks. Before the entrance the Deer Park dam were shut off and now you find trees, well the trees go in there. You have a material flopping in this area, very acute slope, where there was a 160 acres that caved in. Now throughout that cut, it is inescapable and it would\\'ve been inescapable to anyone watching it, the things that it progressed in that area. So we can\\'t say that this action was incapable of perception -- <UNK>  What? <John L. Madden>  A what? Incapable of perception, that you couldn\\'t see it. Now on pages 46 and 47 of his report, the Special Master has this to say, \"The original plan of the engineers was to excavate a narrow 4-mile pilot channel, across the neck and then to permit the natural scouring effects of the river to complete the cutoff by moving through the cut in ever increasing amounts. The pilot channel was dug in the early 1933 and had a slight curve in the middle. So it can direct the flow into Dead Mans Bend on a course approximately south. Still quoting from the report, \"If the cutoff once developed by the river was to maintain its pre-planed course, it was essential that there be uniform caving on both banks of the cut.\" \"This did not occur,” the Special Master says. Instead, the highly resistant clay deposit that we\\'ve reaffirmed with. In this area about where my ruler is pointing. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Instead, the highly resistant clay deposits which engineers encountered in the middle of the cut. (Inaudible) to take a course somewhat west of south. And thus it eroded a less resistant bank of the lower western side. Instead of the water coming around here and getting in this sweep than it -- the water started in this direction here hard against the Louisiana Bay. Still reporting from the Special Master, aside from this unexpected development in the construction of Glasscock Cutoff, it was also a considerable delay in its final completion. This delay was caused mainly by the same clay deposit which continued to settle back into the cut act -- excavation. For this reason, the cutoff did not carry an annual average of more than 50% of the flow until about 1941, eight years after they commenced with the construction. <Earl Warren>  Mr. Madden, may I ask you a question just to orient myself. Are you now directing this argument to overturning a finding of the Master? <John L. Madden>  I am leading up -- I think the best way to answer that Mr. Chief Justice to say that I\\'m staying with the facts that the Special Master found. But I am laying the foundation to be followed by my co-counsel and arguing that certain conclusions of law reached by the Special Master should not be followed by this Court. <Earl Warren>  Well, are you stating to us now just the evidence of your experts or are you presenting to us both sides of it then contending that there isn\\'t substantial evidence to support the finding? <John L. Madden>  Mr. Chief Justice, in preparing this argument originally, it was my idea to single out each four witnesses. But then, I decided that the thing to do was to find out what they all agreed to. And then I\\'d say what the experts say. In other words, what I am saying now in my judgment after reading the transcript, all of the experts agree upon the Court. <Earl Warren>  This -- <John L. Madden>  Yes. <Earl Warren>  Now what\\'s -- that I didn\\'t understand -- <John L. Madden>  Now, the Special Master then goes on to say in his report and that\\'s in page 51. It was conceded by all the experts and is -- excuse me for interrupting with this quotation, but the Special Masters is doing here what I am trying to do with my arguments, to follow the uniform expression of opinion by the experts. “It was conceded by all the experts in Dead Mans Bend would have continued to migrate eastward and to Mississippi --” <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  I don\\'t find that on page 51. <John L. Madden>  It isn\\'t on page 51? <Potter Stewart>  Its on page 40. <John L. Madden>  Oh, I beg your pardon sir, it\\'s on page 40, I\\'m sorry. Would\\'ve continued to migrate eastward into Mississippi had it not been for the construction of Glasscock Cutoff. Hence, but for the construction of the cutoff, the well today would have been well within Louisiana. Now if Your Honor pleased, if you can turn to page 51, there is this quotation from the Special Master. “The elimination of historical Dead Mans Bend has called an erosion into Louisiana in a -- an accretion of aluminum to Mississippi in the first three miles below cut.” Now there\\'s three miles below the cut is the problem here. Now I call the Court\\'s attention to the fact that the railway had been left alone, there would not have been any cut at all because of this highly resistant soil. Now -- the parties to this action and the Special Master agree that the boundary around here is -- it\\'s been fixed. And the -- then Special Master and all of the witnesses agree where the old channel was that follows from A, B, C, X. Then there has also have been agreed by stipulating between the counsel that the previous main channel runs along the line B, X. Now, Special Master had no particular difficulty in reaching the vast majority of his findings but he had difficulty in certain combinations of course that were no river surveys from 1942 to 1951 and now from 1952 to 1954. It was particularly difficult for him to try to locate the position of the thalweg with relation to the well during certain years. Now, may it please the Court, I want to say it very briefly before I close that we have arrived at four major conclusions in connection with the facts that have been found with the Special Master. First, that where in an action of this kind the cutoff is constructed by the United States Engineers through the use of artificial means and the direction of the current has been changed so drastically as to eliminate an entire (Inaudible) bend after creating instead in reverse bend. Then the boundaries should remain where it was before the construction -- before it was started. <Hugo L. Black>  Has that ever been held -- <John L. Madden>  That sir will be discussed by Mr. Carmouche but this Court is not held that. I don\\'t think you have a case Mr. Justice Black. Second, human agencies should not be able to bring about results that acts of nature cannot alone accomplish. The drastic changes made by the United States Engineers in diverting the direction of the channel out of Glasscock Cutoff reversing the direction of the flow is not a thing that nature could have been done alone. Now, if a certain minor changes have made where nature could do it alone, man could do it, then the states are expected to resign emissaries to this minor changes but when a man comes in and completely ignores the nature and does that which nature cannot do, then we think that states like Louisiana in an action of this kind has the right to question some of the old concepts of avulsion. The terms used and the semantics in connection with -- before the third point, I\\'d like to make is that -- and the conclusion we reach is that we are living now in a time when United States had been setup upon a number of years on a wide scale, river improvement program to assist in flood control and wide scale improvement of navigation. You don\\'t have situations now that you had years ago when we talk about accretion from the standpoint of -- <UNK>  Is it? <John L. Madden>  Did it take the sending (Inaudible)? And those old that came up when it took to an American jurisprudence. Now that fourth and the last -- final point that I would like to make, our conclusion is that the solemnity of long existing state boundaries and the propriety rights therein acquired invested interest therein created, protect it and preserve. Now, as you\\'re going to follow in situations of this kind of (Inaudible). You\\'re not protecting those innocent at all and you\\'re not coping with modern day conditions of exigencies. There\\'s no exception in the substantive law after boundaries of space may not be altered except by compacts between states ratified by Congress. Now, if the states without congressional approval and Congress acting unilaterally cannot alter state boundary then it seems to us to be unthinkable that the United States Engineers may change boundaries and destroy titles. Thank you. <Earl Warren>  Mr. Carmouche. <Edward M. Carmouche>  Thank you sir. May it please the Court. The Special Master found as Mr. Madden pointed out in his open statement that the vested rights of the State of Louisiana are directly involved in this case. In addition, some of the property rights of its mineral lessee Humble Oil Refining Company also all the rights of certain Mississippi citizens as well as the State of Mississippi. The Special Match -- Master advised this Court that you should take jurisdiction over the boundary question which should leave these ancillary issues to some other tribunal. Needless to say the problems of taxation of the validity of leases of the administrative powers exercised by the state over the production and sale of petroleum products make all of these factors inextricably bound in with the boundary question. I would like to point out that Louisiana does not wish to submit itself to any other tribunal insofar as these ancillary matters are concerned. We think that this is the only court that has jurisdiction over all of the Courts. Now, I am authorized to say on behalf of Humble and we in Louisiana recognize that Humble may have certain additional defenses to the State of Louisiana as well because they have leased this from citizens from Louisiana as well as the State of Louisiana. Nevertheless, Humble joins with the State of Louisiana in its principle argument on the boundary question. Now, there really three general rules of law which are involved in this case. The first rule is that when a navigable river such as the Mississippi forms the boundary between two states that the thalweg or middle of the main channel is the boundary. Second, the Master stated with accuracy on page 14, when by a natural, gradual and more or less imperceptible processes of erosion and accretion, the thalweg changes, the boundary follows the stream and remains along the varying center of the channel, citing New Orleans versus United States. Equally well established in our law is the proposition of avulsion. When an avulsion occurs, the center of the old channel remains the boundary, County of St. Clair versus Lovingston. Now in the context of these general rules of law and the facts in the record, the position of the State of Louisiana may be stated as follows. First, the changes which took place here are avulsive in nature, are avulsive in effect and therefore in and of themselves are sufficient to cause the boundary to be fixed permanently as it was prior to the work of the U.S. Engineers. Second, the changes here were wholly caused, all witnesses testified this. Were wholly caused by artificial means, the artificial means here used were so extensive and the changes resulting there from were so drastic that this Court is required to rule that the boundary has been fixed permanently. Now, we will show that the changes are avulsive in effect. There\\'re various definitions of avulsion and no one definition is consistently used by this Court. Perhaps the best definition is contained in 56 American Jurisprudence Section 477. Avulsion is a sudden and perceptible loss or addition to land by the action of water or a sudden change in the bed or course of a stream. All of the cases show that there are actually to types of avulsion. One type is where there is a sudden and perha -- perceptible gain or loss of land on the banks. The opposite of this type of avulsion is the gradual and imperceptible process of accretion and erosion. It is in that kind of avulsion which deals only with banks that the element of time and perceptibility become important. The other type of avulsion has nothing to do with the banks of streams. This is avulsion in which there is a sudden change in the bed or course of a stream. This type of avulsion is not the opposite of accretion. We do not have here a change in the bed of the river in the case at bar. But what we do have is a definite and drastic change in the course of the river. In this case, we found that Dead Mans Bend which had previously flowed hard towards the Mississippi bank has been wrenched by the U.S. Engineers and now flows hard against Louisiana\\'s side. This is a complete reversal of the forces of nature. We are here concerned in this case, not with what has happened to the banks, has there been a build-up with the accretion. We are concerned here with the location of a thalweg which follows the main channel of navigation. This is a line in the water and here, time and perceptibility are not necessary in order to contrast what occurred here with some other rule of law. In many cases where the distinction was unimportant, it has even been stated that our second type of avulsion had to be perceptible. The cases indicate that the factor of imperceptibility has never stood in this Court\\'s way in determining an avulsion. If there was a drastic change in the bed or course of the stream, we know of no case where there was a drastic change in the thalweg in which this Court has ever held that the change was not rapid enough to be avulsive. The cases we have examined of this Court show that periods as short as one year or as long as 10 years had been sufficient to be held avulsive. In our own case, the engineers took eight years before the Glasscock Cutoff was even the principal channel of navigation. It was 19 years before the avulsive works were completed in the cutoff. Only in 1952 was the high water flow all through the cutoff, yet no one questions here even our friends from Mississippi, that what happened in this Court was avulsive. On the facts that we have here, there should be no doubt that the changes which occurred were sufficiently rapid viewed with respect to nick of time lapsing in past cases. The change of course took place in the problem area quite dramatically after 1951. Now Mississippi\\'s own contention was, which they vigorously urge show that the oil well which is set fully located in the problem area that the thalweg changed 1500 feet in less than 18 months whereas, it had changed only a thousand feet from its 1933 location in 18 years. Mississippi in its argument would penalize us because the engineers to -- who undertook what at that time was a gigantic task and failed to maintain channel line. They would also penalize us because the engineers took a long time to accomplish their work. We should not be so doubly penalized. We therefore may conclude that the changes here correspond to the basic concept of avulsion and to the fundamental reasoning inherent therein accordingly the same legal consequences falling from avulsion should be applied to this case. Now beyond the concept of avulsion, let us now consider violent changes which are caused wholly by the works of man. Can the works of man which completely reverse the processes of nature as on the facts of this case change the boundaries of states? Absolutely not. Of course there was a time not too many years ago when the power of man to so drastically affect boundaries simply did not exist. There had been a number of instances in the past when water has been diverted or the flow of some -- to some extent change.Generally however until the past generation or so, the power to do this to any great extent was extremely limited. Certain is the case which rivers is powerful in the Mississippi. In this day and age with increased sources of energy available and the increase in technical knowledge, the power of man has become almost unlimited. Today, we find our scientist and our government leaders discussing in all seriousness the feasibility of a canal across the northern part of Florida, the advisability of blasting a path for the Rio Grande all the way to the Pacific Ocean, a construction of dams that defy the imagination. There is pending in Congress today, a bill to study a 30-year project calling for the complete realignment of all the northwestern sources of water and the utilization of presently existing rivers to carry tremendous, almost unheard of volumes of water to the entire western path of this country. Of course, this works are not undertaken lightly, it is generally agreed that they are for the ultimate benefit of the people of our country. But it should not be necessary to weigh this benefit against the laws that it will do to a state if its boundaries have been changed as a result of this work of man. It is not our purpose here to say that this work should be discontinued. It is only to suggest that the rule of law which we espouse today that the damaging effect of these works be minimized, so that the benefit of these works may be fully realized without impediment and without the necessity of any sort of compensation or payments to those who unfairly lose on an individual basis in order to satisfy public necessity. We know that our boundary -- if we know that our boundaries cannot be changed, we remove a major objection to otherwise a worthy project. The rule that we espouse is not a new rule of law Your Honors. In State versus Bowen, Supreme Court of Wisconsin, 135 northwest 494. Their railroad company constructed a dam across the east channel of the Mississippi River to the west of Minnesota Island. The boundary had formally been through this channel. This directed the current around the other side of the island. The Court held that this constituted an avulsion saying, “It is obvious that any change brought in the flow of water by means of a dam cannot affect the question of state boundary anymore than cuts can such change produced by an avulsion.” But neither can have the boundaries of his domain changed by avulsion or by the diversion of water affected by human agencies. In U.S. Gypsum versus (Inaudible), United States District Court Police and District of Arkansas in 1964, the Court held, \"I am convinced, incidentally this was after ten years of dredging by the U.S. Engineers to accomplish the purpose.\" The Court held, \"I am convinced that insofar as the time element is concern, that the shift of the Mississippi River from the dam way to the point way meets the necessary requirement of an avulsion.\" In Whiteside versus Norton, which is an Eighth Circuit Court case of 1913, the Court held that the main channel of the St. Louis River was located north of Tallas Island and at this point fall a boundary line between Minnesota and Wisconsin. The U.S. Engineers dredged the channel south of Tallas Island, the work took from 1899 to 1902 or three years. The Court held that title cannot be divested by artificial and arbitrary process. The case further held that Congress without consent has no power to change the boundary between states still last less does an administrative department, meaning the United States Engineers. We -- the Court held, “We cannot agree that human agencies can suddenly bring about what like acts of nature admittedly cannot accomplish.” Cutting this channel was analogous to avulsion. It could not operate to change the boundary between the State of Wisconsin and Minnesota. That case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. An appeal was refused on other grounds, but this Court through Chief Justice White said, “We are clearly of the opinion that the mere fact that Congress in the exercise of its power to improve navigation, directed the construction of the new channel affords no basis whatsoever for the assumption that thereby as a matter of federal law, rights of property if secured by state law were destroyed and new rights, a property on the assumption indulged in incompatible with that law were bestowed by Congress.” Now in Louisiana versus Mississippi, 350 U.S. 5, this Court adopted the Master\\'s finding. There, the Master held, the construction of dam and cutoff being an artificial avulsion did not alter or change the boundary between the two states. Before development of that dam and point cutoff required eight years and this Court adopted the Master\\'s report as its own. Thank you gentlemen. <Earl Warren>  Mr. McLendon. <Martin R. McLendon>  Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court. We would like to open our argument by expressing the personal and the precession of the state for the fine scholar and the gentleman that the Court appointed, the Special Master to here, this case. The fact that we might agree wholly with his factual findings as will be presented later does not detract from our high regards for him personally and as a legal scholar. We think he found the law of Mississippi -- I mean not all of them Mr. Justice, of the United States as it is and correctly found that the -- based thereon he declined to recommend that there\\'d be any changes in that law. Now, we argued before this Court on December 10th, 1963, Louisiana had taken up the cordial of its lessee, Humble Oil and Refining Company by -- they\\'re trying to take back what the river had formally given them and taken back an oil well to its lessee. This Court rejected that argument, authorized us -- I mean, authorized them to file their complaint. But now, I think it is perfectly clear that all Louisiana is interested in is one oil well. They haven\\'t given one sound legal or logical basis for changing the boundary from the live and flowing Mississippi River to a point that travels across vast and dry land -- across Mississippi accretions. They haven\\'t given one reason for that except of the fact for that there\\'s an oil well involved. Now, we have Mississippi. We\\'ve lost by that river\\'s action. We\\'ve lost cases before this Court on the thalweg theory. In fact, its -- most of the production in the Gulf of Mexico off from the Louisiana courts as this Court decreed that it was, was at one time a point of controversy between Mississippi and Louisiana. And the thalweg theory adopted by this Court was followed by the Court and took it away from it and that\\'s vast field of oil and not just -- and as this Court said in Oklahoma versus Texas, irregardless of how valuable those so vacuous rights become, value has nothing to do with changing rules of jurisdiction and property. As this Court has heretofore announced. Frankly, we would delighted to hear that Louisiana does not even take issue with any of the Special Master\\'s findings. And the Special Master found that the Court will -- with me on page 50. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  What page? <Martin R. McLendon>  Page 50. The last sentence, paragraph E of the 26 Special finding. This change in Dead Mans Bend from 1933 -- 1932 to 1952, although artificially called and not an unusual change for that -- was not an unusual change for that river. And it cannot be considered as sudden and perceptible in the historic pattern it before established. Louisiana alleged in order to ask this Court to take jurisdiction of this case that an avulsion occurred, an avulsion within the bed of a stream. Now, we denied it. Special Master found that an avulsion did not occur. So therefore, it should be dispositive of the matter because they did not prove suddenness or perceptibility. Mississippi was put to the burden of proving that all of the changes took place within the bed of the river. And that between the high banks of that river, every change that was testified to occur, one of our witnesses said so in page 682 and 683 of the record. Another one said so on 818 and 8 -- again, on 826 of the record. Of course, all of those points of their, I think (Voice Overlap) -- <Earl Warren>  They said what to, Mr. McLendon (Voice Overlap)? <Martin R. McLendon>  They said that all of the changes as even as shown by this -- as he put it an -- <Earl Warren>  Yes. <Martin R. McLendon>  -- amateur\\'s drawing of what occurred took place within the high banks of the river. In other words, there has been no abandonment of the bed of the stream as this Court has heretofore call for when it even considered an avulsion. What Louisiana is doing in this case is trying to put the Court before the horse. The facts are that there was a change in the bed of the stream. That stream is a boundary stream. The river is the boundary and has been since the date -- being settled. Now, in addition to that, our records, Volume 4 and 5, which to our two expert witnesses who were renowned authorities on this river testified and the -- Special Master accepted that testimony on the fact that all the changes within this river bed were as a result of erosion and accretion. Since we filed our replied brief to their exceptions, the pre-factories statement if the Court will look at it on opening of the gray brief -- <Byron R. White>  Mr. McLendon, can I ask you, what if the -- what if in doing the cutoff that the project had included anticipation that the flow of the water would run against the Louisiana bank and it might be better just to stretch it out right at the outset. If the Corps of Engineers had said, “Well, we\\'re going to do the cutoff but then we\\'re going to go slice off 50 yards of the Louisiana shore lines or bank, river bank,” and they have gone having done it. Would that have been on avulsion on a -- <Martin R. McLendon>  I don\\'t think it would have been an avulsion, Your Honor. I think that certainly the Corps Engineers (Voice Overlap) -- <Byron R. White>  Certainly, the thalweg would have changed thereafter. There would have been a new main channel as a result of that cutting off 50 yards of the Louisiana river bank. But -- what would have been the result been in your view as to where the boundary was? Would it have been the thalweg or would it have been the old thalweg? <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, according to the rules of this Court as we understand it, if within that 50-yard area, vast land appeared, it would have been an avulsion, yes. <Byron R. White>  But if -- but you say it wouldn\\'t have been an avulsion just because the bank was cutoff by human-hand. <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, Mr. Justice White, I see what you\\'re driving at and I don\\'t know that -- that is not getting close to what happened as a -- and I hate to apparently beg your question but I just -- it didn\\'t happen. The cutoff was through here -- <Byron R. White>  Yes. <Martin R. McLendon>  -- and that is a very distinct cutoff. And I think your question itself is, if I may suggest is -- I mean, implying a bad motive on the part of engineers to slice up a part of a state\\'s territory. <Byron R. White>  Oh, no. <Martin R. McLendon>  I\\'m sorry, if I misunderstood it to that point. <Byron R. White>  Well, you go ahead. <Hugo L. Black>  May I ask you, how much the land there is in that U shape? <Martin R. McLendon>  This part here, Your Honor? <Hugo L. Black>  Yes. <Martin R. McLendon>  I don\\'t have any idea. The land area, I understand from various witnesses, testimony that this old bend way is approximately 19 miles and this is approximately four miles. And of course, there\\'s a notice being an argument that this -- the boundary -- now they argue that the boundary became fixed up in here, but it did but not with the opening of this.It continued to change by erosion and accretion until such time as the river seize to flow and carry navigation. And that\\'s the point where I mentioned a minute ago that trying to put the cart before the horse because navigation never ceased in this area. <Hugo L. Black>  Suppose the Government has to prove the (Inaudible) instead of having 19 by 4 (Inaudible)? What would have been the rule then, is that a change for having avulsion? <Martin R. McLendon>  The avulsive -- the parts of the river that were cutoff by avulsion would -- <Hugo L. Black>  I\\'m talking about the Government decides to (Inaudible) you changed the -- that\\'s what the -- that is the 19 by 4 (Inaudible) 50 miles on side of the stream where it hasn\\'t been -- what would that be? And would that change the state (Inaudible)? <Martin R. McLendon>  We don\\'t think so Your Honor, I mean, because if the -- if that\\'s what they tried to do was straightening out this river from (Inaudible) to New Orleans, and that was a part of the project. And where they have changed it across vast lands, the boundary itself has become fixed. And this of course is still a flowing river but on both sides of the State of Mississippi. Now on the -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  In other words -- there\\'s no controversy here about what\\'s inside the view, the 19 by 4. All of that enclosed in there is Mississippi, isn\\'t it? <Martin R. McLendon>  As we understand it, yes. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Yes. And the -- it\\'s no longer navigable around the bend and therefore wherever the old thalweg was, is that right? <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s right. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  That fixes the boundary between Louisiana and Mississippi, doesn\\'t it? <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s our understanding, and yes because the -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  And the -- <Martin R. McLendon>  -- not because of the cutoff but because that it -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  The bank -- <Martin R. McLendon>  That is -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  What is (Inaudible) is that little segment below the cutoff area that on this map is, B, C, X.B, is that right? <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, that\\'s their version of the Bs -- X line of the course of one that Mississippi contends for. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  The B, X is the one that the Master has taken in? <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s right. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  And the B, C, X is the old -- <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s the boundary that never did ceased to flow as the live and flowing Mississippi River. In fact, they asked for the fixing of a 33 boundary because this alleged that the hand of man can change a state boundary, they asked for a 33 boundary when the proof shows beyond dispute that the river continued to migrate into Mississippi for three years after that. Now, why they want to cut themselves off of that extra three years of yard is I don\\'t know but that\\'s the -- the river was continually flowing from here on down to the Gulf. <Hugo L. Black>  What is the amount of the river (Inaudible)? What is the exact amount of land involved (Inaudible)? <Martin R. McLendon>  Your Honor, the record does not show but there is no land as such that will be transferred, it\\'s a submerged land. It\\'s all -- <Hugo L. Black>  Yes. <Martin R. McLendon>  -- just right within the bed of the river. I mean, I think there\\'s some 2000 feet between the high banks maybe more, maybe less, I\\'m not an engineer. I\\'m not even an engineer to the point of drawing one of these amateur things. We\\'ve got to use the evidence that the engineers fixed. Now, this same argument was advanced to the Special Master. And on page 21 and 22 of the record, he specifically rejected it. He says it may be for the Court to change but I can\\'t conscientiously recommend it. That he started all the case flow because he asked them on more than one occasion during the trial of this case. Do you have any authority of that an avulsion can occur within the bed of a stream? And they haven\\'t come up with it. Except the specific point in the three case, the four cases they discussed except within a specific point where the actual dredging took place. Process of erosion and accretion took place below that. Now, the Special Master also found that the rules of erosion and accretion are to be preferred in all instances. That is when a boundary stream is a -- a flowing river is a boundary between the states. Now, they mentioned the thalweg grew, I don\\'t think that\\'s a separate rule. The thalweg grew was established in Iowa versus Illinois, so landmark case. And in that case Your Honor, there was dredging -- not dredging, actually the record showed that the rock, hard rock was excavated to change the navigable channel, 300 feet closure to the Iowa side. It\\'s a case in that -- that the issue in that case was who was -- detached the bridges across the river. In the bank shown, page 4 of the Special report, that the -- who was -- someone dredged out 300 feet closer in order to make access to United States Canal farther on up the river. That was an alleged fact and admitted for the purpose of this Court. And that was the case where this Court established for the jurisprudence of this country, the rule of the thalweg, that is along the main mid-channel of navigation. The Court came along 25 years later on Arkansas versus Tennessee and said, “The rule of the thalweg was settled by that decision and we will not attempt to tamper with it,” that is just 25 years ago. That\\'s been over a merely hundred now. So we\\'re not just talking about one oil well. As the Court said in Louis -- Oklahoma versus Louisiana, we won\\'t change the jurisdiction of property rule because of mini-oil well. We\\'re talking about the boundary of everybody that borders on navigable streams in this entire country. Can the hand of man change it from a flowing stream as it was made by trees before the country was a nation, when it was still a nation of others? That it was made on by nature, as it was made by acts of admission and in truth and in fact was stipulated too by the parties in this lawsuit. Now, one other significant rule that we think is important, again in Arkansas versus Tennessee where this Court said, “It is settled beyond the possibility of dispute that were running streams are the boundaries between states, the same rules as between -- same rules applies as between private proprietors. Namely, that when the bed and the channel are changed by the natural and gradual processors known as erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the very thalweg bearing course of that stream.” Then of course it goes on and announces and in a -- and that\\'s the exception to that rule. And that case if the Court please, it\\'ll find when it -- when the status, that was the same case that said even though there is an avulsion, the boundary, the thalweg boundary continues to waiver by the processes of erosion and accretion until such time as the streams ceases to be navigable. And there is not one shred of proof anywhere in that merely a thousand pages of record that this was ever anything with the delight of employing Mississippi River down from the beginning. Now, the rules that we\\'re talking about, that is erosion and accretion, go back -- had been traced back by this Court, and we certainly recognized it a -- the -- they\\'re tracing back was more further than we could possibly do it but they were traced back to the rules of just any end, which was the original or the codification of the common law. That is the fact that erosion and accretion, that boundary changes property, private property or public property, boundary changes by their physical fact of erosion and accretion, the boundary moved with those erosion and accretion. <Hugo L. Black>  Is there any difference in the accretion with the rule (Inaudible)? <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, there\\'s a -- as Arkansas versus Tennessee said, I just read it. It was the same rule as between private parties. Now, in St. Clair County versus Lovingston, which is another landmark case in this country, this Court held as a matter of law annunciated the issues and it said, one was the mix -- first one was a mixed question of fact and law, and the second was a question of the law. Then the Court said, “It is insisted by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in there that the accretion was caused wholly by obstructions placed in the river above and that thence the rule under the subject of alluvium do not apply. If the fact to be so, the consequence does not follow, there is no warrant for the proposition. The approximate cost of the deposits made by the water, the law looks no further.” We have no doubt that that language -- in similar language in all of these cases is what prompted this -- the Special Master on page 17 where it vividly do point out that the Court always looks to the result and not the cause. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Would you know of any other cases of (Inaudible) St. Clair that dealt specifically with the matter of artificial man-made causes of erosions? <Martin R. McLendon>  Yes, Your Honor. Kansas versus Missouri, it\\'s cited in our brief dealt with. The Corps of Engineers erected dikes to -- for the specific purpose of relieving or changing the channel, and the Court held it -- that was not enough to sustain Kansas provision. Mississippi versus Louisiana, which was the last page we had. This two states had anything to do with was a case involving one of these 15 cutoffs that extend from -- oh, one above Memphis and the rest of this is the lowest in the chain of following down the river. One of this 15 cutoffs, the Court took the thalweg around the bend way and fixed it where the river had died where the navigable channel had stop. And in the areas where it was still navigable, the thalweg was held to be the boundary in that case and this Court followed it. I don\\'t know where they\\'re innocent until they had anything to do with artificial thing, but in -- if the Court will note, our brief also in 134 ALR page 556, there is an excellent annotation on erosion and accretion and the artificial causes there. I mean this is not a thing that would -- this Court has been plagued with original actions dealing with flowing boundaries. But if it -- that\\'s Louisiana\\'s theory, that for no reason at all in 1932 that boundaries still eroding away into Mississippi. For no reason at all, it\\'s because of few drops of water came flowing down here. That boundary became fixed if not only would -- they\\'d just -- I can\\'t conceive of the amount of litigation that will resolve, it\\'s bad enough already with each others throat every time something valuable comes up. But if you start changing the rules and as we observed in our brief, it\\'s very simple, the rule are -- let\\'s say, somewhat -- I may be over simplifying and I hope not, certainly the Special Master thought that they were simple and to the point. The rule is erosion and accretion and the one exception is avulsion. Now, the reason for that rule is because people don\\'t go out there where they end up where a river is. I mean, the river is flowing, it\\'s alive, it\\'s going day and night. And the rules are -- of necessity must have to be simple because it can get to the most complicated facts of situations in the world even with. Now in relation to that one oil well, what flows -- I\\'m going to ask the clerk if he will distribute to the members of the Court copies of Mississippi Exhibit 2. We had him taken out to the files yesterday, we have ten copies up here. And would ask if it -- if the Court -- well, it\\'s a (Inaudible) copy and it illustrates the point that we think needs to be illustrated at this time. As we were tracing our background on this erosion-accretion thing, frankly and I believe was the man who\\'s credited by this -- all of having brought it, transferred it to the common law and this has been adopted as I pointed out in St. Clair versus Lovingston. Now, what we point to illustrate by this is the Court held in St. Clair versus Lovingston that the river and right to future accretions is a vested right. It is comparable to the flux the owner of the flux and he -- being entitled to the increase or as the Court said the fruit from the tree, the man being entitled of the fruit if it\\'s barren. Now, the rule -- it\\'s a very poor rule, it doesn\\'t work both ways. Now this river as we pointed out has been the boundaries since the beginning of history of either these two states as states. Now, this that I handed you is a copy of the -- from the Land Office of Mississippi, it\\'s a original copy of an original survey of this area of the river. Now, you will note on there that there is a U-shaped black circle on the -- starting on the upper left-hand corner and coming down. There is a different shaded circle -- I mean, different shaded rectangle of a thing bordering the river. And over on the right of that different shaped rectangle, the thing there is a line that\\'s written on there proximate bank line of maximum recession. That is before the river started flowing the other way. The point of this illustration is that Mississippi when it was admitted into the Union, this particular oil deposit that Louisiana now seeks us -- seeks this Court to change the rules for, was under vast lands within Mississippi. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  That\\'s in that Block 11 -- <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s in that Block 11 and the point there of the arrows pointing to it Your Honor. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Now those -- would you tell me again Mr. McLendon, what\\'s that proximate banking of maximum -- <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s the proximate bank line of maximum recession. This is -- that what you see over there on the left-hand side is the river boundary in 1832. That was some 15 years after Mississippi became a state. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  So all of 11 was Mississippi vast land. <Martin R. McLendon>  Mississippi vast lands, in fact it was an irregular session -- section because of the -- as is noted there on the left, the South Coast. Now it\\'s noted from there that Section 7 which wasn\\'t irregular section has gone down to the Gulf so or some place else. It\\'s no longer there. It\\'s gone forever. And parts of 16th and parts of 10th and then parts of 3, and all of four was the line that we drew, didn\\'t go quite that far. We drew it for emphasis of this one point. Mississippi lost this oil well by the rules adopted by this Court. And they can -- Louisiana can speak for Humble Oil they want to. But we don\\'t see that Mississippi should now after a natural change has brought it back in the Mississippi, there\\'s just no equity or justice in letting us lose it again by changing the rules. <Abe Fortas>  You said seven, did you mean 17? <Martin R. McLendon>  17, pardon me Your Honor. I was looking rather far of that from of there than you -- you\\'re absolutely correct, Section 17 is gone. That\\'s the one was shaded out with this light. <Hugo L. Black>  May I ask you whether the fact (Inaudible) other than Mississippi and Louisiana? <Martin R. McLendon>  Yes sir. Beg pardon? <Hugo L. Black>  What are the factors (Inaudible) the oil having been the concern? <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, my associate -- <Hugo L. Black>  So that in Mississippi or Lousiana? <Martin R. McLendon>  My associate counsel Mr. Teller was going to discuss the ramifications of it. There were two oil company -- <Hugo L. Black>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, I mean I just wanted to point out that there were two oil companies and they leased both sides of the river. And they had a surreptitious agreement between them. And that the boundary was fixed by them and not recorded. So whatever their consequences I think that they have made there bed that there should be committed to -- by it. Now I just -- I want to close out the Court -- well. I just -- one last thing, we asked that this Court, not change the state boundaries for the benefit of one oil well. If refused to do it, in Oklahoma versus Texas as ample present to everything we\\'ve said and I promised my associate that I would divide the time equally, he will speak to the other issues. Thank you Your Honors, I appreciate it. <Earl Warren>  Mr. Teller. <Landman Teller>  May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices. We are here as Your Honors will find after you have an opportunity to restudy these former decisions that had been announced by this Court, dealing with a firmly entrenched rule of property. One, which the -- must be governing millions of miles where boundaries through streams divide boundaries between property. And as Justice Brandeis promote in one case and most instances, it is more important that the applicable rule would be of law be settle than that it\\'d be settled right. However in this case, we don\\'t think it\\'s any doubt but it\\'s not only settled by the wisdom of ages. But there is settled right and I\\'m going to carry a moment if I may to further go into that one picture. I did not -- there is -- they are asking for a rule which will cause the Court to say, because in 1932 they -- (Inaudible) as they had a right to do and this is not questioned and I would like to cite one case which was not cited in our original briefing, I call it to the attention of the Court if I may. It\\'s a case of Gibson versus United States, 166 United -- U.S. 269 and that\\'s a case which recites that riparian ownership such as this is subject to the obligation to supple the consequences of the improvement of navigation or flood control in the exercise of the dominant right of the Government in that regard. And that the -- when the Government does this works, they are simply asserting a right belonging to the Government to which the riparian property is subject and not of a right to appropriate private property, not burden with such servitude to public purposes. In short, this Court has held that the damage resulting from the prosecution of this improvement of a navigable highway for the public good was not the result to the taking of appellant\\'s property and was merely incidental to the exercise of a servitude to which our property has always been subject. Now people own lands up and down the river, know that they can gain (Inaudible). They apply those, the states require it, subject to a paramount right of the Government to develop those lands. And it has been stipulated, as a matter of fact we agreed on a number of facts that the Government in this case in cutting this particular cutoff was exercising a lawful and unquestioned right to improve navigation and flood control. Now, if we start looking to cause and if we abandon the laws of accretion and erosion and just say, “What is the -- or is this going to be -- is the land going to be affected downstream because the Government did something upstream?” No one will ever know what they own, where it begins or where it stops, and this case is an example of that. While the State of Louisiana -- when they came into this Court and they -- they\\'ve got it in their brief that they filed that and they even announced their desire, I distinctly recall but I can\\'t be confirmed by the fact that\\'s in -- their supplemental brief they filed before December of 1963, said that this very area in dispute were downstream 12 miles that the effect of this could be felt 12 miles down in the (Inaudible) Bend that you could measure them that far. Now when they get to try in the case is an oil well -- we can only measure them three and a half miles because after this, the configuration starts -- calls the Louisiana to gain lands. You see, this is not an accurate portrayal of what it existed if they say it just accrued now but it is. There are many that are -- and absolute that you do have in this record volume. But that is embarked but if this comes about, it has made, it has tended to make a bend that\\'s coming in this way and going out that way. And as it goes out this way, Louisiana has gained and they say that and the Special Master says that and their brief admits that. So then -- but they want this Court to stop -- but when Louisiana stops gaining, (Inaudible) -- they say stop right there, this is the point. We can measure up to here and that therefore the line (Inaudible) before somebody else comes in and measure it. I tell the Court if they will change this rule, you\\'d have to have a Special Master going to measure down further so each year it has the further effect that cause this (Inaudible) here. It\\'s different that it would be before -- when it wasn\\'t there. I mean, the flow of the water, the consequences. And they may have computers that it\\'ll be able to measure it all with that to New Orleans. And they will say in the future -- a few years come up here and say why, don\\'t fix the line -- yes, that it was in 1932 and 1933 because this is the (Inaudible) cutoff. So this idea of this new computer, we didn\\'t know that last year but we have now gotten this new measuring device and we can tell you with positive sentient, these people who just own lands in the states who thought they would boring on the river, states who had the river as their boundary no longer have that river as a boundary. It\\'s where the thalweg of that river happened to be when they opened the Glasscock Cutoff. Now that\\'s the reason for the wisdom of the ages, that\\'s the reason that -- that this is a rule that has come down and applied (Inaudible) from Justinian through the civil law, through -- into Brocton, to the common law and Louisiana is going against the (Inaudible) of its own Supreme Court in this very meddle, in this very meddle. There is a case of Esso versus Jones in which the State of Louisiana was a party, an active party. And then will -- which involved Glasscock Cutoff, this area from Y, right around here, stopped there, it\\'s all -- further it went because what was involved in that case, there were accretions up in the cutoff alone, this very cutoff, there were accretions up in this area and the -- it will question whether the private Louisiana citizens only or the State of Louisiana and there was some more. So all those brought the litigation on in that case and as they said why, the private owners own the accretion until the water quit flowing and they comment citing St. Clair County versus Lovingston, their own State Supreme Court of Louisiana citing that case said, \"Well, there (Inaudible) no one would be foolish enough to contend that the law of accretions and erosions was repeatable all to put out the cutoff.\" They say -- they said -- I dare say, no one would do that. But the Supreme Court of Louisiana was mistaken because that -- with almost concurrent the -- of State of Louisiana had determined to ask for the fixing of a permanent line, limited to an area of three and a half miles. So we say that -- we\\'re here tampering or they\\'re asking that a rule be tampered with, which prompt the owners throughout this nation have lived with and know, and can learn, can determine what they own and what they don\\'t own. And these very parties did exactly that. This cutoff was constructed in 1932 or 1933. Louisiana made this place leased to Humble. In 1964 -- no 1948, and when they described it, they didn\\'t described it as in the line over here between B and X. They didn\\'t do that because their job or knew that wasn\\'t the line. They described it as downstream along the Mississippi River flowing meandering thereof. And at the Humble -- at the part of that -- that\\'s where they\\'re leased to, that lease -- then Humble got some leases from a number of people in the Mississippi side, 13 in numbers. And they got together and they confected an agreement and that said agreement which is the reason for this lawsuit. And they said on November -- well, the first thing that happened was -- Humble, this came out of the (Inaudible) as Humble -- Humble put one of its experts on the stand. And he had developed that he had studied this problem and had made a report to his superiors on March the 31st, 1953. And in that report and I am virtually quoting it, he said that if -- of course if you want to file the line below the foot of Glasscock Cutoff, you will have to get a current hydrographic survey. And he mentioned that it was the thalweg of the Mississippi River. Well, in November of 1953, some six-eight months later, and he also predicted that this line was going to -- there\\'s going to be a development favorable to Humble because this was going to shift more to the west and that is an evidence before this Court as Humble\\'s Exhibit 10 and Humble\\'s Exhibit 11. Now, they did -- they went and confected this agreement between themselves in November 1953 and on a recorded document which they recited. That whereas the thalweg or (Inaudible) of the stream of the Mississippi River, you know that that is the community line to buying the leases, called it from Louisiana and that Mississippi leases from the various Mississippi landowners. Which thalweg or rather a stream is subject to change from time to time pursuant to the natural action of the river and the accretion or erosion resulting there from? Now that\\'s Exhibit C4 to the complaint. So they knew what the law was, the law they deny it, can this Court to change. They went on to say that whereas after the line may change, that it may embarrass them in the operations. And this two or (Inaudible) Humble did on Carter, I don\\'t know what that -- had anything to do with it. But the agreement was signed on behalf of Humble by Mr. Davis who was one of the -- Mr. Marvin Hugh Davis, the top vice-president and on behalf of Carter by Mr. F. M. Darwin. And they said that that they were going to determine an operational line irrespective of the true boundary between the States of Louisiana and Mississippi at the tip, person, or any changes that may be brought therein. So, they picked it up as between themselves and that was a line to which they drilled when they elected from Carter they get to drill a well west of that line. So then it was the boundary line was, they didn\\'t have any difficulty in knowing. And so I think if you got a rule of law that people know what it is, that that\\'s a pretty good rule of law. That\\'s one that you can live with and that\\'s one that they were able to get along with. Now, there are several things that they -- their exception number two while it wasn\\'t discussed much was that they have -- except to the Master\\'s recommendation that the only -- that this Court only decide the boundary issue. They want this Court to decide the litigation between the (Inaudible) family who happened to own Section 11 in Mississippi and Humble Oil and Refining Company. Now, we suggest that there is no jurisdiction in the original action to let -- to determine the rights applied to citizens that the only way that this Court\\'s jurisdiction is derived from the constitution, it\\'s original jurisdiction, this can\\'t be either limited by the Congress nor extended by the Congress as far as the original jurisdiction. And the appellate jurisdiction is -- takes by the Congress certainly, not would govern private parties. Now, we have in our brief covered these features and I don\\'t think it\\'s really -- I don\\'t believe it\\'s even -- that the actual jurisdiction would exist in the Court to try a damage suit. You see, this is -- that is the way that the matter originated. The (Inaudible) family who owns Section 11 sued Humble Oil Company, nobody else for a subsurface trespass for the taking of oil which they said underlay their property. They filed that suit in the United States District Court and in for the Southern District of Mississippi. That was done on November the 27th, 1962. The answers were filed by Humble, just any number of defenses, you can guess otherwise there\\'s a estoppel, there\\'s (Inaudible) Mississippi statute of limitations that this Court could have -- would have to decide that -- is whether its leased or whether it is not leased, there\\'s this any number of issues that -- or in that part of litigation. Now then Louisiana filed their suit saying, “Wait a minute, the thalweg is not the line as these property owners saying that Mississippi -- that we understand the State of Mississippi to believe.\" But it\\'s a fixed line that exist over here by reason of this cutoff and so they filed a suit, they filed a suit on May the 13th, 1963. So the question is now whether -- of course that -- we recognize everybody, that\\'s an original action had between two sovereign states. Well, the line is where the thalweg happened to be in1932 or where it -- where the live thalweg is now as it was when the states were admitted in to the Union. I mean, that\\'s what -- what it was to begin with. Now, has it ever ceased to be? What has caused it to ceased to be within these latitudes? <Byron R. White>  Well, do you think the only issue in the case is whether it\\'s -- there\\'s been an avulsion or not and if there -- <Landman Teller>  Well, I must -- <Byron R. White>  -- there hasn\\'t been -- if there hasn\\'t been -- if we agreed with you that there has not been as the case over there and that (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  That -- our opposition as far as this Court is concerned -- <Byron R. White>  We don\\'t even need to -- <Landman Teller>  -- and that the only reason that those other private parties, they even made parties originally was to stay that litigation. <Byron R. White>  But you even -- you even go further and say that the -- where the thalweg was in any year including 1964 or any other year is immaterial. <Landman Teller>  That that is -- we do not think that that is essential -- <Byron R. White>  Well, is the (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  -- to the -- to this -- the Court\\'s decision because after all it\\'s the same thalweg that divides Mississippi and Louisiana in every -- in all other reaches of the river. I mean, it\\'s a live thalweg, that\\'s the way it is between the other states. And we see no reason why it\\'s essential for this Court to go beyond deciding that one issue. Where is the boundary? And once you\\'ve done that, of course that will -- it would be like an alternative as far as this litigation is concerned because the party stipulate that if the present time the oil well is 950 feet east of the live thalweg. <Byron R. White>  Well, will it make any difference -- would it make any differences between the State of Mississippi and the State of Louisiana as to in -- as to where the oil well was? <Landman Teller>  We say not -- <Byron R. White>  Didn\\'t say in 1954? <Landman Teller>  We say not Mr. Justice White but it does not between the state because whatever sovereignty they had exercised in the past has already been exercised. We can\\'t see where there\\'s any dispute between the two sovereign states that depends on a past or historical line. You know that the exact geographical position of a past or historical line. That\\'s happened -- that once you get out of the -- between the party, the litigants, between the Lew Carrols and Humble, is going to make some difference. It may make some difference if -- if when the -- if the State of Mississippi starts claiming severance taxes from Humble which have not been paid to it. But that won\\'t be between the -- it won\\'t be that -- anything between the State of Louisiana and the State of Mississippi that would make -- depart or make any difference. Now we -- <Byron R. White>  Well, what if Humble\\'s got some claim against Louisiana? <Landman Teller>  What? I couldn\\'t hear you Mr. Justice White. <Byron R. White>  Well, what if Humble then claims over against Louisiana? <Landman Teller>  Well, it was Humble who elected to pay them and the Eleventh Amendment of the constitution would just give Louisiana either the right to a -- <Byron R. White>  I mean, what if they had waived it in the lease? <Landman Teller>  What? I couldn\\'t hear you. <Byron R. White>  What if they waived it in the lease? I mean, what if -- what if there\\'s a provision where -- what if Louisiana doesn\\'t have its sovereign immunity as against this lessee? <Landman Teller>  Well, it may be that Humble could recover from Louisiana but that wouldn\\'t be between Mississippi and Louisiana. <Byron R. White>  Well, if the -- it\\'s a -- (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  I say if they waived it, it may be that they could recover but I don\\'t -- <Byron R. White>  The dispute between (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  As a matter of fact -- <Byron R. White>  It\\'s a dispute between the two states to who\\'s entitled to the severance taxes from 1954 to today, isn\\'t it? <Landman Teller>  Well, that wouldn\\'t be between the two states as to who is entitled -- <Byron R. White>  Well, both of them can\\'t get it out of Humble to say -- <Landman Teller>  Well, other (Voice Overlap) -- <Byron R. White>  Let\\'s assume that. <Landman Teller>  -- its true Humble has already paid to the State of Louisiana and it could be that Mississippi could sue Humble. There is no question about that. And in that sense, Humble could be subject to possible double liability. But I was trying to confine my answer to the fact that as between the two sovereign states, there is no dispute or controversy. And I will say this that the lease on file shows, you impose the question to me, supposed it have waived immunity. Well, they not only didn\\'t waived their immunity but they didn\\'t even give them a warranty lease. They just gave them a lease without a warrant so the -- I -- can I -- I mean in the sense if the question is theoretical, they did not. That -- I don\\'t think that lease waive an immunity because it was even without warranty. So now, we make the other position to the -- we have the other point that with reference to the fixing of that line in 1954 that the Master -- we do question, we say that that is not supported by the others, his fixing of that line. And I wish I did have the time to go into, but may be I -- first, I don\\'t have the ability to do it but I need the -- with the ability I have, I don\\'t have the time I would say then, to try to explain why we feel very comfortable that the thalweg was in fact west of this well location at the time it was drilled. And we have gone into that in our brief as exception number B, and I would say this to the test -- this in a way a test to the correctness of it, they have -- they didn\\'t respond to that, they didn\\'t do it, they didn\\'t undertake in any way. It\\'s a -- there\\'s a yellow copy when we filed our exceptions. We attached to it and what the -- a map along the exhibits. And that shows -- actually the thalweg is the deepest part of the stream, it is the flowing stream. Coincidentally in 1952, and I say coincidentally are very fortunate that for the cause of truth. In 1952, there was a special governmental survey right in this area. Now the only reason it happened was because there was this -- it was -- they were in trouble then, navigation was in trouble and they had to send the boat joggling down there to dig out a canal on this -- to scoop out some of the channel on the thalweg so as to get it free from navigation. And you can take this official governmental document here with the navigation charts which we have introduced into evidence. This shows, they were on October 3rd, 1952, the Government actually discontinued what had been known better for as Dead Mans Crossing, actually discontinued and put down below this well site a new light called Fairview Light, now that was the passing light. And if you will go by the governmental navigation charts, in all that you will find the thalweg was definitely to the west and the Master recognizes it. But he said that he thinks that maybe that was a temporary course. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Is that the one with the yellow circle you said going down? <Landman Teller>  Yes Your Honor, that is the one that the evidence showed and it goes through the dredged area there and the part in the river that\\'s where they threw the (Inaudible). It\\'s a much shorter, we go into all of the reasons why we feel that that is the proper line and if it -- if the Court feels that it is essential to decide where the thalweg was, we feel that -- I mean first, we say it was necessary. But it is necessary, we say that it -- to be properly done, it would follow-up this line and this evidence. Now the other point we make -- <Hugo L. Black>  Why do you say it\\'s not necessary? <Landman Teller>  Well, because as to the consequence we -- don\\'t even said it was necessary, we said it wasn\\'t necessary as to the controversy between the states. Because we say that the Court will have determined that controversy when it says no to Louisiana that you have no permanent fixed line in this area but you have the same line that you always have. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  The live thalweg? <Landman Teller>  The live thalweg and that is the point we make. The other point we make -- <Abe Fortas>  That would mean -- I wonder Mr. Teller that it -- go back to the District Court following your thought as to what don\\'t happen and go back to the District Court and then that would have to be litigated there. <Landman Teller>  Yes Your -- yes Mr. Justice Fortas. <Abe Fortas>  Okay. <Landman Teller>  The Lew Carrols (ph) suit is on filed on the District Court. <Abe Fortas>  I understand that. <Landman Teller>  And it would have -- and it would be litigated there just as any other -- <Abe Fortas>  The state is not a party to that. <Landman Teller>  The state is not a party to it, no states are party to it. And they -- and the -- while they say that Louisiana is a necessary and indispensable party, if they all are, they\\'re going to win the case. I can tell you that. Well, we don\\'t -- because we don\\'t think that they are one but I mean if -- because Louisiana will never be able to -- I mean, the Lew Carrols (ph) will never be able to make Louisiana a party to that litigation which is filed in Mississippi. <Abe Fortas>  And what you\\'re saying -- I beg your pardon Mr. Teller, I want to get this straight if I can, what you\\'re saying is that, the only issue that this Court ought to decide is the issue of theory of principle, that is to say, we -- you had it the way you want it if this Court would say no to Louisiana\\'s request that we adjudicate the proper line to be the 1932 line. <Landman Teller>  And -- <Abe Fortas>  But we just say no and then stop there, is that your (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  Well, I think it would go affirmatively and say that the proper line is the thalweg as it always has been -- or the Mississippi river in this area. <Abe Fortas>  And then we don\\'t go into what is the line of thalweg as in -- <Landman Teller>  Well -- <Abe Fortas>  -- the particular time. <Landman Teller>  I only suggest that because we didn\\'t think it was of substantial or necessary issue to the dispute between the two sovereign states. And that\\'s the only reason. It will be necessary and indispensable issue to other litigations which we know will come up. Now, the other point that we make and that is (Voice Overlap) -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Excuse me Mr. Teller, I managed (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  Yes sir, sure, (Inaudible). <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Am I right in what you\\'re in effect saying is, if you were right that it\\'s a live thalweg that the severance forming between the two states, where it was located on a particular date may have a relevance to this private litigation but it has no relevance to any issue between the two states, is that it? <Landman Teller>  That is the point that we\\'ve make in the issue from the Court. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  And therefore that -- there is no reason for us to get into a location which is significant only to private parties and that\\'s what you say. <Landman Teller>  We suggest that in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of this Court, it should be confined to the controversy between the states as -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  This is a -- I take this position have to had another essential fact if that is that you are in agreement, that both states are in agreement as to where the thalweg was in 1964 and then every year thereafter. You have no current dispute as to where it is. <Landman Teller>  But we -- there\\'s a stipulation filed at the -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Yes, okay. <Landman Teller>  -- Exhibit C to the -- stipulated October 26, 1964. Now I say one other thing for -- to show how well we knew how to agree on thalwegs, we agreed on every other one except the 1952. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Right. <Landman Teller>  And I think that you\\'ll find -- <Byron R. White>  And every year thereafter until 1964. <Landman Teller>  Yes. Well, of course that\\'s right but you\\'ll find that the reason that it wasn\\'t agreed on was not because Mississippi departed from the rationale and the rules that were applicable, but because Louisiana was unwilling to do so. They wanted to adopt a sailing line which was eliminated on the very date -- which was the cause -- let\\'s say, there being made and was eliminated on that date. Now the other point that we have to make and I -- which will make an exception to and it\\'s covered in our briefs, I hope they\\'re able to -- what is pertains to the courts. And we know that usually cause are assessed or divided equally but we have reason that we feel that all of the cause in this matter should be assessed again Louisiana and we have assigned those briefs. I certainly thank the Court for your kind attention. <Earl Warren>  Mr. Carmouche. <Edward M. Carmouche>  Thank you Your Honor. Your Honor, perhaps it would be best for me at this time to briefly state our position. Louisiana is not here today asking this Court to set a permanent boundary in every instance where the work of man has had something to do with it. We are not asking this Court, for example that the Government constructs a jetty and the forces of man and nature combined to accelerate accretion or erosion. We do -- we\\'re not asking for a change in that route. We are not asking this Court to abandon the principle of law annunciated in St. Clair versus Lovingston and the land of White cases cited by our opponents. We believe that they are real and solid distinctions between those cases and the case at bar. We are saying first the law of accretion and erosion is perfectly good law unless you have an avulsion. And then accretion is not preferred by the law, if it is avulsion that is just as an honorable a principle of law as the principle of accretion and erosion. They are different and they occur in different situations. So we are saying that all you have to do is restrict the facts of St. Clair versus Lovingston to it\\'s own facts and apply the facts of this case which makes this an avulsion or analogous to an avulsion as has been done by this Court in the past. Now, St. Clair versus Lovingston is good law if you\\'re trying to figure out what happened in the old bend way. And I agree with my learned opponent when he said, what happened in the live river is something different with what happened up here. St. Clair versus Lovingston would give to the riparian owners in this area the accreted lands, the built-up lands as long as there is a thread or current going through the whole bend way, that\\'s not the situation in this case. If we had built an effective dam here and we have built an effective dam here, there would be no accretion or erosion in the whole bend way. It just simply couldn\\'t happen because it is the flow that causes the accretion. Now, what we are dealing with is a line in the middle of the water, it is an imperceptible line, we couldn\\'t see where this thalweg was in the first place. We don\\'t know where it is today, we don\\'t know where it was in 1932 unless you could somehow get below that water and find out where that deepest trench, where that valley, where that main channel of navigation was. By its very nature, it is not perceptible. Nor are we dealing here to a build-up of land on the Mississippi side and an erosion on the Louisiana side. We\\'re attempting to locate a line in the water. So we say that there are two major distinctions as between the cases cited by our folks, St.Clair versus Lovingston and the cases that follow it and this case. First, St. Clair versus Lovingston and its follow-up cases were not dealing with boundary. We are dealing with boundaries here. Second, St. Clair versus Lovingston and these other cases were dealing with accretion to the bank. That is a build-up of land on one side of the river. We are not dealing with that here. Needless to say every point I made in my opening argument was a distinction between St. Clair versus Lovingston in this set of facts. That is, that the works of man intervene in such a drastic way as to completely reverse the forces of nature. Now let\\'s look at the equities. <Earl Warren>  Before you get to that, may I ask -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes sir. <Earl Warren>  -- just one question that -- at what point below the cutoff does the rule of avulsions and the rule of accretion and erosion begins -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes sir. That\\'s very easy. <Earl Warren>  -- if that happen? <Edward M. Carmouche>  That is what we have determined as point X. <Earl Warren>  You have determined (Voice Overlap) -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  This has been found by the Master. <Earl Warren>  Beg pardon. <Edward M. Carmouche>  That -- the Special Master found that the results were measurable to point X. <Earl Warren>  I see. <Edward M. Carmouche>  Now, we are saying that from B to X is a completely measurable situation. And between these points, a fixed boundary should be in place and this will not open Pandora\\'s box, this should not give the court any trouble. Now let\\'s talk about (Inaudible) which is from X to Z. Sure we contend it in our brief that changes occurred there but we take the position that from X to Z the changes are immeasurable. We can\\'t tell how much was done by nature and how much was done by man. So we are not asking that -- from the thalweg be fixed in that area. We are asking the Court to apply the rule only to the measurable portion of this river and that is the foot of the cutoff to the foot of Dead Mans Bend. <Byron R. White>  Could I ask you one -- <Earl Warren>  Can I ask just one more -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes sir. <Earl Warren>  -- question and at what point below does the land start to accrete to Louisiana? <Edward M. Carmouche>  In here Your Honor, between X and Z. Do you remember Mr. Madden was talking about, you got accretion on the current banks, you get -- on the concave portion, you have the erosion, they\\'re eating the way. Now, I believe that what I have to say about progress may help us in this particular question. On page 11 of our brief, the question was asked about a particular diagram there. What we are saying on page 11 is that if left to its own devices, the river will compensate for itself. If the forces of nature are left alone, the heavy portions of this land will be the river. And if that happens, the live thalweg should be the boundary. But what happened here was that because wholly and solely, due to the work of the United States Engineer, the current was diverted at right angles and now heads into Louisiana where it once headed into Mississippi. Now let\\'s see the effect of it. When the engineers made the Glasscock Cutoff, we didn\\'t gain the area to the west of the live thalweg in the cutoff, all the engineers took there was an easement. So Louisiana holds nothing in the live river from Y to B. As a result of this cut and the thalweg being placed over here, Louisiana owns nothing of Dead Mans Bend, and that remains the property of the State of Mississippi. As a result of the cut, every survey since 1765 shows that the current had been beating against Mississippi in this point at the rate of some 70 feet a year. So let\\'s talk about that one. If nature had been left alone, we would not be facing the Lew Carrols (ph) in this case because they not only would own the furniture, they wouldn\\'t own any land at all because in the 33 years, this is the last, between the building of this cut, if that river had continued going 70 feet a year against Mississippi, they wouldn\\'t be anywhere around. So we\\'re saying that what we\\'re asking for is complete equity. And it is not equity to say that a hoop hair bend Louisiana will begin again to see some accretion. We have lost our accretion here and we\\'ve lost our accretion in the bend below it, as a result of this cutoff. So you have reversed the forces of nature and Louisiana loses in two bends in a row instead of every other bend. <Abe Fortas>  Why did you take the year 1932? <Edward M. Carmouche>  1932 was the beginning of the dredging Your Honor in the Glasscock Cutoff. <Abe Fortas>  But the effect upon which you relied did not occur then, did it? <Edward M. Carmouche>  That is correct, Your Honor. This work went on for some eight or nine years. The dredging itself, as I pointed out from my principal argument.During that time, you have some water going through the cut and you have some water going through the bend way. It was not until 1941 that more of the water began to pass through the cut than pass through the bend way. <Abe Fortas>  But it doesn\\'t -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  But we must remember that while that was going on, you had two conflicting forces. Here, you had water heading towards Mississippi and water heading towards Louisiana. So its effect is almost neutralized during the period of the work. The rule of law, which we filed, is that this boundary should be permanently fixed as it was immediately prior to the avulsive act or the work of man. <Abe Fortas>  Are you talking about the -- you\\'re referring to the avulsive act and as the date that first started (Voice Overlap) -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, sir -- <Abe Fortas>  -- digging. <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes sir. <Abe Fortas>  Now, would there be an effect on Humble\\'s claim on this lawsuit if the cut in 1941 rather than 1932? <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, sir. Louisiana -- if you took part of going to Louisiana would win and so with others. It\\'s only when you get -- in fact the Special Master plan that the thalweg actually crossed the well location after 1954. That this well was drilled in Louisiana, it was completed in Louisiana, and it was produced in Louisiana. Then he picks a date somewhere subsequent to that well being drilled and says the thalweg move passed it. Now that brings us to the rationale of the case. If this Court holds that this is a permanent remedy as existed prior to works of man, which could be any time prior to 1954, then you have no ancillary issues in this case. There\\'s not one single of the issue but if you hold that -- as the Special Master did, that this well was drilled in Louisiana and produced in Louisiana but that at some later date because of this shift its now in Mississippi, you can see the manifold problems that will be created to the state and these are not private problems between the litigants, we\\'re collecting severance taxes right now on that well. We\\'re collecting (Inaudible) on that well. What was the point at which those rafters should have shifted over to somebody else? What was the point where we had to quit collecting our taxes? Remember gentlemen (Voice Overlap) -- <Byron R. White>  Why (Inaudible)? Why -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Sir? <Byron R. White>  Let\\'s assume we decided -- assume that we thought Mississippi was right on the avulsion point and that at some point the thalweg did shift over and the well get in the Mississippi, why is it an issue between the states as to when it did it, as to when that thalweg passed over the well? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Alright, Your Honor, today, there was one other governmental point -- <Byron R. White>  When you both admits that in 19 -- as of 1964, the well was -- if it\\'s the live -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  But sir, we -- there was not (Voice Overlap) -- not admit that. <Byron R. White>  I know but -- if there\\'s -- if that line is the live thalweg you admitted. <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, sir. <Byron R. White>  You still argue the live thalweg is to the east of -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  All we have stipulated in this case now is that in 1964, that that thalweg then was west of the well location. <Byron R. White>  Alright, alright. <Edward M. Carmouche>  The Special Master found that it moved over pass the well some time in (Voice Overlap) -- <Byron R. White>  But why is that an issue between the two states, as states -- if the thalweg is the rule, what issue is left between the states as states? I grant you, there are issues between Louisiana -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  As I pointed out, our taxing power Your Honor, a right to settle out. It was everyday Louisiana tells this company how many barrels of oil they can produce from this well. Now, another point I would like to get straight and this is really a problem in the case. We are not here fighting over an oil well. Its true there is one oil well located in the problem area, but we want this Court to realize that if you set a live thalweg, Louisiana will lose an entire oil field, that there are some 26 producing wells in this immediate area. The Special Master and all the witnesses found that the cost of this cut, it\\'s now eating at -- into Louisiana more that 70 feet away. Those surface locations will begin dropping out. We will then have the problem -- are those wells owned by Mississippians? Are they owned by citizens of Louisiana? Everyday is going to make the change. Not on this well, but on other wells in the fields located within 50, 60, and a hundred feet of the river bank, and all of those appear in the records Your Honor. Now, to finally summarize and close, apparently, the Master was bothered about three things in concluding that this was not an avulsion. First, was the element of time. The element of time in this case is no longer than the time element in which the United States Supreme Court in St. Louis versus Rotz said that an avulsion took place. So we can eliminate his worry about time whether this was rugged. I may also add that in terms of geologic term, in terms of the power of man to accomplish great jobs that what occurred here took only an instant. Second, the Special Master was worried about the perceptibility, yet where was the perceptibility in St. Louis versus Rotz where you had an island that just shifted a mile and a half down the river? That was not -- no more perceptible then what went on here. Third, the Master and Mississippi seem to think that you had to have an actual change in the bed in order to have an avulsion. This Court has already held time and time again that you can have an avulsion where you just have a piece of land that\\'s slides off of my land and clops up against somebody else\\'s land. There\\'s no change in the bend there. This Court has held time and time again that an avulsion can occur where you have a change in course or a change in the channel. We deal with the same thing. That we submit gentlemen is what happened here. I would like to close on a note of liberty, I never thought that I would live to appear before the United States Supreme Court arguing on one hand for the sovereignty of a state\\'s boundary and to maintain the state\\'s integrity and have the State of Mississippi on the other side saying, “Don\\'t worry about federal interventions.” Thank you. <Earl Warren>  Number 14, Original, State of Louisiana, Plaintiff, versus State of Mississippi et al. Mr. Madden. <John L. Madden>  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. Set down for our argument at this time is a motion of the State of Louisiana for a leave to file a complaint against the State of Mississippi based upon a boundary dispute between those states in the area of the Mississippi River. Included in the motion is a prayer that all proceedings be stayed in the case of Joseph S. Zuccaro et al. versus Humble Oil & Refining Company, which is Civil Action Number 1011 on the docket of the United States District Court for the Western District of the Southern -- the Western Division of the Southern District of Mississippi. That stay is requested because of the dominant issue in that case as to the location of a producing well and the only way that the Court could possibly decide this case would be to decide the boundary dispute that exist between Mississippi and Louisiana. If we had only one case to present in the argument, that we would like to make today, it is Durfree versus Duke. That is the sole substance of our argument. It is a very logical opinion, very intelligently presented and when read particularly when Judge -- when Mr. Justice Black\\'s concurring opinion is read with it then I think we have the answer to the problem as presented here today. Now, we have here a chart, we want to show something about the locale of this dispute. Heights rises, its circumstances and anything that the Court may be interested in. Realizing, however, that we are here asking to come in the Court, we\\'re not here on the merits but as I take it from this very learned opinion that there\\'s only one way or two ways to settle a boundary dispute between states. One is in the original jurisdiction of this Court and the other one is in a compact according to Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution. It seems to me that so far as our motion is concerned, we -- we certainly should not have to sit by and find out what the Federal District Court in Mississippi is going to do about the boundary. So we have no forum except to come here. Now -- <UNK>  Could you intervene in the private litigation? <John L. Madden>  We -- we could Mr. Justice Harlan but we do not wish to because we will find ourselves in the same position almost as if Mississippi would come in and we would not come in. You see, we wouldn\\'t have those two States vis-a-vis each other, contending in that same court and there would be no judgment that would be binding it if Louisiana would -- would come into it, then the judgment down there would not be binding upon the State of Mississippi. Now, we -- we think that there are some five questions that we should go into as briefly or as fully as our time would permit and if the Court directs it, one does have jurisdiction, then properly invoked. Second, is the justiciable controversy presented. Third, are the States of Mississippi and Louisiana, the real parties of interest? <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  I didn\\'t hear that quite. <John L. Madden>  Are the States of Mississippi and Louisiana, the real parties of interest? Fourth, does the complaint state a cause of action? Fifth, should the proceedings in the United States District Court be stayed? Now, the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked of course under Article III, Clause 2, paragraph 2 of the Constitution in which the jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court and simply which the state is a party. Then in Section 1251, Title 28, United States Code annotated, paragraph 81, there is a -- original and exclusive jurisdiction if the controversy was between the States. Now, if there is a controversy of the state with a -- with the citizens of another State then that is the original jurisdiction. Now we have had to bring in as defendants in this case, Humble Oil & Refining Company which is Louisiana\\'s own lessee and the Zuccaros who are claiming the land in Mississippi. I\\'ll get into that in a minute to show why they\\'re claiming to this water bottoms rather than a -- than the State of Mississippi because they are parties down then the suit below and I think that whether they are essential defendants or not, they certainly should be nominal defendants in here to present any objection if they might have to in defining of this complaint. Now, I have here by my side and to the back of me an easel on which a map is presented. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Mr. Madden, may I just ask, you\\'re not suggesting that these private parties are necessary for this? <John L. Madden>  No sir. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  In other words, you might -- your position is you could have brought this -- Louisiana could have brought this lawsuit against Mississippi and have ignored what\\'s going on with this (Voice Overlap) -- <John L. Madden>  Yes and -- Mr. Justice Brennan, I think I\\'ll have to clarify that answer in this respect and that Louisiana now is one of a -- practically, all the States of the Union that have the right title to navigable water bottoms by raising of a title that is by virtue of its inherent sovereignty and has held on to that. But in Mississippi, the riparian owner owns the thread of the stream whether the stream is navigable or not. Now since title and boundary has some qualities and elements that together or still we do not say that the Zuccaros are indispensable but they\\'re certainly -- if we could distinguish between indispensable and unnecessary, then I think they should be before this Court. They and the State of Mississippi have come in jointly and answered it or rather filed an objection to the filing of this complaint. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  But that any -- any -- in other words, what you\\'re telling me, this is not really necessarily a fight between private parties in that sense, is that it? That there is at least connected with that kind of claim something of Mississippi\\'s claim intertwined, is that it? <John L. Madden>  Yes. For instance, Louisiana\\'s interest, I -- that would be taken up in time by my co-counsel but Louisiana has a two-fold interest in this matter. First, is proprietary interest, it owns these navigable water bottoms and it owns this producing well, that is the -- that\\'s on state own land and it gets ruined, a substantial (Inaudible). At the same time, the state has the sovereignty interest, the governmental interest that -- of regulating the production of the well, police powers and all of those are powers of sovereignty. Now, Mississippi has those two, that\\'s why they\\'re in here because this boundary is so linked up with the question of a -- of its jurisdiction and of its sovereignty that it is necessarily a party before this Court and an -- an indispensable party because the judgment in favor of Louisiana on the boundary matter, of course would not be binding anywhere if the -- if it -- the other state involved was not before the Court. Now, I want to get to -- this is not presented, may it please the Court, with any idea in mind of trying to take – to state Louisiana\\'s position on any controversial issue but simply to show the Court the locale. Now, this map was that if you\\'re -- to some (Inaudible) miles above Natchez, Mississippi and it run going down for about 40 miles below. Now, you will notice very large loops in that river and that\\'s not just common to that particular area but it\\'s all the way from Cairo, Illinois down to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Now in the Great Flood of 1927, the Corps of Engineers decided that they were going to have to devise some plan of shortcut of this river on the way to the dock and there were some 15 cuts. In some of those instances, there were all erosions, man-made erosions but it made no particular consequence because when the water got through the -- the channel, it -- it went back to its old channel and so there wasn\\'t any question there of -- of any -- any change in the boundary. Now we get to this Glasscock Cutoff right here which is one of the most tremendous conversations that the Corps of Engineers have -- have -- have ever protected and tried to harness these waters of this area here. Now this area is called (Inaudible) band area, that\\'s the area in which the suit of Esso Standard versus Jones were decided by a Louisiana Court in which has absolutely nothing to do with this case because this case here, what we are dealing with now is the Mississippi River not an old flow that comes through here. That involved the Esso case -- involved a question of where the State owned land and that of riparian owners ended, and again, in an area west of the river. Now, in this case, when this -- the water started and comes down here and so were trying to get the (Inaudible) the water out of proposition. The water was going very, very heavily against the Louisiana bank. The plan at first was to -- was to have this in -- into to this bank of the Mississippi side here and that was a direct channel and get it out of this bend but they found out after many years, they have effort that it was too resistant. Then the channel went at great speed directly across where you can see the green line here in this part of the river. Now we say that this producing well was drilled on Louisiana land. We do not even say now that this well or is not in Louisiana soil. <Earl Warren>  Where was -- where is the well? <John L. Madden>  The well, may it please the Court, is located approximately in this (Inaudible) <Earl Warren>  Yes. <John L. Madden>  My point is this. <Earl Warren>  Yes. <John L. Madden>  And the least -- the Louisiana stream runs out on the dam in Mississippi River into (Inaudible) point here. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Is the well in the riverbed itself? <John L. Madden>  Yes. Now, the Mississippi says that this well is in Mississippi territory, we say it\\'s Louisiana. But now we have -- we say this that if that well has -- is in the State of Mississippi now, then it was brought about by this avulsive action of a tunnel and that therefore, the original boundary should not be stirred. We\\'re not getting into a question of accretion. Accretion is not involved in this matter. It\\'s the underwater beds that\\'s involved in this dispute. Now, may it please the Court, I believe I haven\\'t got a minute just to begin probably the second thought of the argument and that\\'s on the -- on the justiciable nature of the controversy. <Earl Warren>  Would you like to start that (Voice Overlap) -- <John L. Madden>  I would like to -- <Earl Warren>  We\\'ll recess now gentlemen. <John L. Madden>  Thank you. This morning in trying to describe the area and that was about all I was trying to do not to set up any particular process where we might locate the well because if -- if the motion is granted, then we go to a special mass and then we find out all of these matters on the merits. But I referred to the lease this morning as covering an area since in here all the way down here. That is an error. Suppose that the fact did -- the argument I was making was at the time to get this water out of this (Inaudible) bend, the lease that we\\'re referring to sought right here and learn toward down for quite some distance down and to what is called “Deadman\\'s Bend”. Now, it\\'s not all the -- Mr. Chief Justice Warren at we have a well that\\'s located I think it -- if my worthy opponents will permit an area of this mass of thing have put up here says much, we can give you a better idea of where this well is located. Now, we do not agree that that is the exact location with reference to its boundary, the boundary of the area. Now, may it please the Court, in two other points, I would like to bring out first -- <UNK>  May I ask (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  Yes. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  No, sir. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  No, sir. That -- that was -- I believe it flow after flow of 1940-1941. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  I believe that\\'s correct. It has some stream columns of (Inaudible) but I think the river itself is -- is confederating here as of beyond 1940-1941 to a map by the Mississippi River Commission. The reference to the leasing of this area was Louisiana as the owner of the naval flow waterbeds throughout the State. Then the lease Carter Oil Company on May 10th, 1948, it covered a large area as I have indicated here of the Mississippi River but particularly the area on which this producing well is located. In here, annual rentals were paid until drilling again. You see the annual drilling was the cause of cessation of the annual rental payment. And having security permit to drill from the Louisiana Department of Conservation, a well was putted in on March the 2nd, 1954 at a site on the west bank of the river and in direction with drill. Of course, that is necessary on account of the fact they can\\'t drill in this if the river does not permit it. And at a point which at that time and since, as far as I can think it go, the well is on the -- it was bottom under the river on the Louisiana side of the boundary. The well was completed as an oil producer on April 27th, 1954. Carter and Humble -- now reported Carter Oil Company and Humble Oil and Refining Company merged on December the 1st, 1959. And from that time forward until the present time, Humble owns the lease. All royalties were paid to the State of Louisiana from production as one-eighth on oil and gas and other liquid hydrocarbons until February 1st, 1963. The suspension went into effect at that time for one expressed reason and one only. And that was the filing of the Zuccaros case down in the Federal District Court in Mississippi. Humble simply quit paying the state royalties. Now, that is the condition of the -- in the history of the leasing in this particular area. Now, throughout -- this is not the only well in the area. It\\'s only one in the stream here in this particular area of the river. Now, this in production all around in this area here someday have been some dry oil, some producing oil wells, some producing gas well. So it\\'s not -- it\\'s not located simply in an area that just has one well, but it just happens to be that this one well is there in exact disputed territory between Mississippi and Louisiana. <Earl Warren>  May I ask, Mr. Madden, I thought you (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  I think, may it please the Court, that it should cover an area of that of -- I would say of about 12 miles of -- beginning here at the Glasscock Cut and running down here all the way -- all the way down up to the end of this -- this particular bend. Now, the reason to that is this. You might find some area down here, I don\\'t know. We haven\\'t gone down that far where Mississippi may gain some land. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <John L. Madden>  May gain some land as a result of imperceptible accretion. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, have -- have you posed an issue on the complaint for that whole 12 miles? <John L. Madden>  Yes, we -- we mentioned that whole area in the complaint but we did not make amidst in bound description of it. We just refer to this general bend area of that Deadman\\'s Bend. <Byron R. White>  But this area is affected by the same consideration that the specific well occasion -- <UNK>  We had to stop the -- <John L. Madden>  That -- that\\'s true. <Earl Warren>  And that is all, all that is affected, that 12 miles? <John L. Madden>  Yes, yes, that\\'s correct. <Earl Warren>  And is that affected by that cut that you showed us? <John L. Madden>  We -- we say that it is affected by if it has been affected at all. Now, Mississippi takes the position that this way only been Mississippi. We say that it\\'s still in Louisiana but that if there has been any change in the location of this well which would throw the thalweg, a wave on the other side of the well, then it has been caused by this man-made avulsion. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  And therefore does not affect Louisiana\\'s claim? <John L. Madden>  That\\'s right. That\\'s correct. Now, turning to the question of a justiciable controversy, Mississippi and its opposition had referred us to a number of cases. We refer to them, ourselves, as being -- some of them as being requiring review test those other small labor. For instance, we have cases here in which -- in Arkansas versus Texas which says that the Court go out of reaches behind. It\\'s behind the nature of the controversy and beyond its palm to find out the State\\'s reapportionment in that. And then we have another case, an old case of -- of Connecticut versus Massachusetts which says that the Supreme Court will not exert power to control conduct of one State at two of another unless threaten invasion of rights is serious and clearly established. Then the case of Texas versus Florida, we have an alternative proposition. Either the complaining State must have received some harm or injury from the other State or there must be a right, a substantial right involved that is in jeopardy and a right that could be imposed. But the point that I wish to emphasize on Court is after reading these actions on original boundaries in this Court, I don\\'t find any harm or injury mentioned. Nothing is having anything to do with it. It\\'s just a question. Is this dispute there? Does it exist? Is it real? You don\\'t have to have an arm conflict. You don\\'t have to go as far as the -- this Court acted very quickly at one time and saving that these two States against almost to all conflict back in 1901. There were case in 201, 202 Louisiana 1. But now, one or two of the cases I mentioned now I have taken party in this scope. We have a bill of complaint here in the last case between Mississippi and Louisiana decided by this Court in 1955. I have before me the complaint, the bill of complaints. At bill of complaints says just about this, that a controversy has risen in the complainant, State of Mississippi and the said State of Louisiana that a few portion of the borderline between the two States that no agreement has been reached and can be reached so we are having to invoke the original-jurisdiction of this Court. Now, we are trying to say that all of these harm and injury and of all of this acuteness, these behemoths between the States very severe pressure in the regulatory power simply is not required in this boundary actions. Now, you take the case hereof Mississippi versus Louisiana which is decided in 1928. There this Court said the record sustains the Master\\'s finding that there is no proof that Louisiana or its citizens knew of or every east in any purported dominion of Mississippi over the disputed territory. And it went on -- and the Court went on to say that the first knowledge of the complainant\\'s witnesses knew anything about the dispute, derivable action was filed. Now, in this case, Mississippi there is not saying that a boundary does not -- that a dispute does not exist. It simply says that this is not justiciable enough to burden this Court with it or words to that effect. Well, if -- if a controversy is justiciable and that the boundaries in dispute, I don\\'t see where you can drive and decide on the weight of the controversy in deciding whether or not the jurisdiction held this Court should be exercised. Now, they jointly deprive interest in opposing Louisiana\\'s motion to file a complaint and it said on page 7 of the opposition, “We do not relinquish any right or title that we have to this area.” Now, if they don\\'t relinquish it and -- and pour that up, then they are claiming it and they\\'re claiming it against the State of Louisiana. We believe that a justiciable controversy has been presented and the other requirements of whether a reasonable action had been made and I wished to turn over the remaining of our time to my co-counsel. I think he would discuss the question of East Mississippi -- East Louisiana the reported in this case. And that is a question and further has a cause of action had been stated. We think that required the Court of our pleading that must be examined. <Earl Warren>  Mr. Carmouche. <Edward M. Carmouche>  Thank you. May it please the Court. I think my colleague has illustrated them in the first 30 minutes that a conflict actually does exist between the State of Louisiana and the State of Mississippi. And this is the only form that can finally determine the controversy been in exist between the two States. We feel that there is considerably more involved in this suit from the fact that we have just lost our royalties. Mississippi seems to infer in her brief that this is a very unimportant thing and that said she is not exercising her regulatory powers of this term that there\\'s really no controversy. But when you stop to think about it, of course, this well has produced to date almost a million dollars worth of oil. It\\'s still producing and we hope that it will continue to produce for a long time. But that\\'s not the -- the sole issue. There are many other wells located in this area. Now, as my colleague pointed out prior to this avulsion, prior to the cut being made by the United States engineers at Glasscock, the current in the Mississippi River was flowing east to the bank of Mississippi River. That meant that erosion, if left, the natural processes would\\'ve continued to move east and we would\\'ve been cutting farther and farther into the State of Mississippi. The United States engineers in making this cut and I may point out here that when we are referred to our Master that we can prove and will rely on the fact (Inaudible) one of the earliest cuts made by the engineers that they didn\\'t know quite is much about the subject as they do today. And by mistake, that cut was made in such a way that you -- part of the current, instead of being directed towards Mississippi, it now bounces all towards the Louisiana bank and we know that that thalweg will continue to move westward. So, we have other areas, other wells affected in this suit of the companies and we believe that all of these things are at issue and cannot be decided unless this Court takes jurisdiction. <Byron R. White>  The thalweg is frankly a new word to me, that\\'s the midpoint of the main channel? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, sir. That is probably the preferred definition by this Court. Also, there had been many definitions about thalweg in the past. We readily admit that the thalweg is usually the boundary as East Mississippi\\'s contention. And if you will leave to nature that thalweg would be the boundary, the middle in the main channel. But in an avulsive situation, the opposite is true. If this is an avulsion, this Court has said time and time again that the boundary is the thalweg as it existed immediately prior to the avulsion. And so we feel, therefore, that this movement to the west does not affect their boundary, it cannot affect their boundary and that we have a controversy before you. Now, Louisiana and Mississippi are the real parties and the interest in this controversy. Louisiana\\'s claim here is both proprietary and governmental in nature. As my colleague stated under Louisiana law, the State owns all navigable waterbeds to its boundary. Mississippi, the riparian owner owns rather than the State. Our State is entitled to all royalties that are payable from wells that are located on the beds of navigable waters. And until the Zuccaros has filed this suit, we were receiving those royalties. Then about three months prior to the filing of the complaint, before this Honorable Court, on the law of cease paying our royalties because of the cloud that had been cast on our title by the Zuccaros. Now, in addition to this proprietary claim of -- of Louisiana, we are also acting in a sovereign capacity in regulating this territory. The State of Louisiana issued the permit to drill this well. The State of Louisiana granted this lease to Humble Oil and Refining Company. The State of Louisiana set the allowable on this well. We have exercised all police powers, the -- the exercise up until the filing of this suit. Now, we also have exercised our sovereign capacity of collecting all taxes such as severance taxes and ad valorem taxes on the property involved. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  General, what has happened in (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  They are held in Esso, yes. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  Not in Court, but almost simply refused to pay us our royalties because this suit is pending against us and in the event the Zuccaros when this suit in Mississippi in the District Court, then naturally our title will be in dispute. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  Now, if this Court does not take jurisdiction, it\\'s quite easy to see what\\'s going to happen. If a Mississippi jury approval determines in this damage suit that this land lies on the State of Mississippi and they\\'ve got to reach that position in order to give damages for trespass then, do you think that the State of Mississippi is going to sit on the fact and not collect severance taxes? That they will not attempt to regulate the flow of this well? That they will not set units? We\\'re going to have a multiplicity of suits out of this unless this Court ceases jurisdiction as it should on the prior jurisprudence. The fact that Mississippi has not exercised any of these powers today is meaningless as long as there is a possibility that they might exercise it, our title will always be clouded. Now, my colleague mentioned that a mileage of some 12 to 15 miles is affected by this avulsion. Now, that\\'s considerably more property than the Zuccaros own. But being fundamentally and all company attorney and Attorney for the State, member of board, it\\'s quite easy to see that nobody is going to make any beds and by any leases in that area until this situation is straightened up. <Byron R. White>  Well, Mississippi -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Nobody -- sir? <Byron R. White>  Mississippi hasn\\'t, for a minute, suggested that this well or any of this land is in fact in the State of Louisiana, has it? <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, the Zuccaros say it\\'s in Mississippi. <Byron R. White>  Well, I know, but does the State of Mississippi doesn\\'t concede that it\\'s in Louisiana? <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, they simply say that they reserved all of their rights which is tantamount for saying if the Zuccaros win, we\\'re going to step in. We\\'re going to let Zuccaro fight our battle for us and if he wins, then we\\'ll lose. <Byron R. White>  So they -- you\\'ve asserted -- Louisiana has asserted its title to this land and Mississippi neither -- neither admits nor denies it? <Edward M. Carmouche>  They reserve their rights which I think that\\'s a correct statement, yes. <Byron R. White>  An ordinary pleading, I suppose, that would be a denial in effect? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, sir, but I do not believe that the question of jurisdiction of this Honorable Court should rest with what Mississippi wants to do. Their decision to litigate or not litigate is completely immaterial. The question involved before this Court is, does a boundary dispute exist? Is it real? Is it substantial? <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) Mississippi law, then the class suit belongs to the Zuccaro not with the State. <Edward M. Carmouche>  That\\'s right. Yes, sir. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  So you can see why they would prefer to sit back and fight this in another day. But if the Zuccaros win, they\\'ll tax our well. Now, what\\'s going to happen in Louisiana? <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  By the way, may I ask you this, you told that the Humble has stop paying oil lease -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  -- and has stop paying taxes to Louisiana? <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, sir, it is paying taxes. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  And it\\'s affecting Louisiana\\'s allowable (Voice Overlap) -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, sir. Now, here is our position. In the event that you allow this Mississippi jury who would naturally be biased to determine whether this land is in Louisiana or Mississippi, from that moment on, these powers can be exercised by the State of Louisiana. Now, what\\'s the Humble going to do to us? They paid out all of these losses over the past years. We feel that certainly Humble would sue us for back raw offense, for back severance taxes. They would destroy the unit because if this land is in Mississippi, Louisiana had no authority to sell a unit. What about the money that they paid us as a lease bonus when they purchased this lease, the rentals that they pay prior to drilling the well? They\\'re just a multiplicity of problems involved in this thing in the mere assertion of jurisdiction is immaterial, I think, to the Court today. Now, the very fact that the State of Mississippi is here acting jointly with the Zuccaros evidence is their interest in this controversy. They are here primarily in a capacity of parens patriae. As you pointed out in Kentucky versus Indiana, the appropriate appearance here of a State by its proper officers either as a complainant or defendant is conclusive on this point. Now, Mississippi takes the position that this is a private controversy between the Zuccaros and Humble. Nothing could be further from the truth. They state even further that we\\'re appearing here on behalf of Humble. Louisiana\\'s interest in this matter is that of lessor to lessee. We have an additional interest in that these royalties ceased being paid to us as I pointed out. I pointed out some of the consequences that would occur in the event that the Zuccaros either win or do not win their case. We\\'re going to have suits regardless of the outcome of this district -- of this Mississippi jury\\'s verdict as to the ownership of this land. And only last week, it\\'s seem conclusive to us that when this Court rule in the case of Durfee versus Duke that you clearly saw the multiplicity of suits that could arise if you simply allow this Mississippi jury to go ahead and reach it\\'s verdict. Here, you have a situation where a question of ownership was tried completely through the State of Nebraska, all of its courts. Then, you started out in the Missouri courts and it was removed to the Federal District Court in Missouri, came up completely through the court system to the United States Supreme Court at which time you pointed out only last week that had anyone come up here and asked for original-jurisdiction if the battle would have been settled. That is what we are trying to avoid, gentlemen. There is no way to settle this case unless we are here on a matter of original-jurisdiction and that is -- that is why we are here now in order to cut out this vexatious, the multiplicity of suits that are possible. I believe that we have stated the cause of action in our complaint. Now, in answer to our staple that we have stated the cause of action, Mississippi relies on two cases. One is Esso Standard Oil Company versus Jones and St. Clair County versus Lovingston. I have the honor to participate in the Esso Standard versus Jones case. I think that the case has nothing whatsoever to do with the case in controversy here today. In Esso versus (Inaudible) -- California et al., we were dealing with the ownership of accretions in the old bend way after a cutoff had been and the river was no longer effective in the old channel. There, we had no question whatsoever of thalweg or boundary. It was a question of whether when the pond of Mississippi was cutoff whether this body of water was a lake or whether it became a stream. And the Louisiana Supreme Court held that as long as this body of water had (Inaudible) of its own, which it did at the time that the suit made in the stream regardless of whether that act was made by a man or nature. And so, the second question in the suit was has this body of water silted up and became land instead of water, who owns it? And the Court held that the riparian owners were the owners. They reached that decision based on the Lovingston case. But here, we have an entirely different situation. We have an avulsive situation in the new channel. In the old channel, your changes were gradual and imperceptible. Now, how can Mississippi contend when you take a massive drainage and start excavating land that that\\'s gradual and imperceptible? It\\'s simply beyond lee. Yes, Justice Goldberg? <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, all you have to do is have a dispute in which the State is a party under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. We are part. We feel that we are a party to this controversy. Our rights have been jeopardized not might, they\\'re having it. So, regardless with Mississippi\\'s position in this matter, we feel that the Court should accept the original-jurisdiction as it\\'s granted to you by the Constitution of the United States. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, sir, I said original-jurisdiction. There is a distinction in boundary between two States. You have exclusive and original in the case that you mention in the hypothetical, it is original-jurisdiction. Now, I believe that we have discussed efficiently the Jones case and pointed out that that case is good law but it\\'s simply inapplicable. It deals with accretion. Now, there are a myriad of cases dealing with avulsion, Arkansas versus Tennessee, State of Nebraska versus Missouri, and others too numerous to mention. All of these cases hold that when -- where running streams of the boundaries between States, the same rule applies as between private proprieties and that is that if the stream from any cause, natural or artificial suddenly leaves its own bed and forms a new one by the process known as “avulsion”, the resulting change of channel works no change of boundary which remains in the middle of the old channel. Now, I think we\\'ve demonstrated in our complaint in up here today that we have stated a cause of action, we alleged in our complaint that this well was drilled in Louisiana and remains in Louisiana. Therefore, we have a controversy. <UNK>  Are you going to deal though with the question of -- assuming that jurisdiction is accepted with -- as to whether the private litigations should be stayed? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, sir, yes, sir, that\\'s my next point. <UNK>  Oh, I\\'m sorry, I\\'ll let you finish -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  My time is up. I\\'ll have to handle that in reputation but I will have it, Your Honor. <Earl Warren>  Mr. Teller. <Landman Teller>  Mr. Chief Justice and Justices of the Court. It should be my object to show that there are really is not here alleged a permissible or legal boundary dispute that actually that\\'s not an issue before this Court when you properly understand this situation and exactly what has here been alleged to the Court. Just as Mr. Carmouche was sitting down, he says that an avulsion and he said it correctly according is an instance where the river leaves its bed and it forms a new one. We have no such situation as that here involved. We have here a case where the Mississippi River is now since 1812 has been and as far as we know, it will continue to be the boundary between the States in this particular area. And if this Court is going to fix the boundary in this case which is the burying thalweg of that stream, you\\'re going to be fixing the boundary from day to day and every other case up and down the -- well, the river is 2500 miles but there\\'s not that much difference in the boundary. I mean, for instance in -- in Louisiana -- between Louisiana and Mississippi, I asked the so-called expert to tell me the -- how much boundary there was from the 31st degree of north latitude to the 33rd which is the place of common boundary and he said that it\\'s 198 miles. Now, I don\\'t know that. That\\'s what I just told. They all in that area, some cases whether been either man-made or natural avulsion. Now, there was no avulsion in the Duke versus Durfee case that you\\'re dealing with. And here is what we would like us to get before the Court. It\\'s -- it\\'s alleged in the complaint and we thought it might be of service to might give you a little map and we put one up here. This is it to my -- to the Court\\'s left. Now, we attached to a supplemental brief which we filed. And I would a -- a map. And this is the map of -- the original of which was -- was reproduced. That\\'s the gray document. Now, superimposed is -- this is -- this happens to be a 1962 map of the general area. Superimposed on that map, we have a point called (a) which is the head of the cutoff. Now, that was a Glasscock Cutoff, which is shown here on this stream map. Then we have a point called (b) which is a toe or foot of the cutoff. If -- if you can follow me, I believe we can get this -- we -- we can accept the situation. <Earl Warren>  Yes. <UNK>  (Voice Overlap) did you say you filed a separate amended brief with the map? <Landman Teller>  We did geology in Graver. And it -- it\\'s supposed to have a map attached to it, each one. So that is the foot of the cutoff. Now, below that, south of that area is the area which Louisiana says is in controversy. Now, if you will notice that the avulsion took place between (a) and (b). It took place in this -- in this bend way which extends to the -- to your left or west on the map and went a course of 16 miles around the bend. No question about the fact if that was an avulsion. It was a man-made avulsion. And it didn\\'t change the title to anything either above it or below it. Now, what Louisiana is here saying is that they also might -- that below this avulsion, below this point (b) that the title became fixed in the year 1939. I even know that continues as the Mississippi River is the only river, it\\'s the flowing stream. It has a live thalweg. And that was 16 miles up to 12 miles downstream. That -- I don\\'t know why they stopped there. They could go on down from New Orleans if it was -- out of -- going down the state line. And 12 miles downstream would be down to the water bends -- water grimes bend, I guess, that they -- they want this Court to inform the Master to tell him where the live thalweg of the stream is. <Byron R. White>  What\\'s stream (Inaudible) in the -- in the location of the river down below the cutoff is because of the -- the water running in a different angle or -- <Landman Teller>  As -- as a result of the cutoff? <Byron R. White>  Yes. <Landman Teller>  Well, that question has been pretty well laid at rest by the case of St. Clair County versus Lovingston which was decided in 1874 by this Court and which has been followed in the jurisprudence of -- it may have a set of rule of profit as follows on the jurisprudence of almost every State in the -- <Byron R. White>  What that -- what that case holds? <Landman Teller>  That case holds -- it doesn\\'t make any difference whether it\\'s natural or artificial just so long as the intention there was not to create a change in ocean. And actually, there are reasons, and this is coincidentally in one reason we feel so sure about position, very recently the Supreme Court of Louisiana had occasions to deal with the situation in the bend way. <Byron R. White>  Well, do you understand that Mississippi or Louisiana, in making this assertion, that the location of the -- of the boundary line or the location of the thalweg below the cutoff has been radically changed as the result of the cutoff? <Landman Teller>  I would think -- <Byron R. White>  Is that in the assertion? <Landman Teller>  -- that Louisiana is saying that they have a vested right to their boundary as it existed in the year of 1939 -- <Byron R. White>  Yes. <Landman Teller>  -- when that foot -- when that -- <Byron R. White>  And that the boundary would change or that -- <Landman Teller>  And -- <Byron R. White>  -- the thalweg was -- <Landman Teller>  And then -- <Byron R. White>  -- changed as the result of the cutoff but that couldn\\'t change the boundary. <Landman Teller>  Well, they say that the -- that if they were entitled to a vested right as of 1939, the Court would have to form a map to go back and find out where the thalweg was in 1939 and fix that as a permanent boundary. <Byron R. White>  But they are saying that the thalweg has changed because of the cutoff. <Landman Teller>  As a result -- <Byron R. White>  Yes. <Landman Teller>  -- of the -- of the cutoff. <Byron R. White>  And that a -- and that a -- a changing thal -- a thalweg, it changes because of a man-made cutoff that changed the boundary. <Landman Teller>  Well, we are saying that the thalweg had changed it because of a man-made cutoff does not change the boundary. That thalweg remains a boundary. We -- Mississippi is saying that. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, doesn\\'t Louisiana say the same thing? <Landman Teller>  No, if they did there\\'d be no dispute about the boundary and that\\'s what I want -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  I don\\'t follow -- I don\\'t -- I didn\\'t follow that fact. <Landman Teller>  Well, then I -- I best -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  When you -- when you -- may I just -- are you just suggested that what they want have done in this action is that they\\'re be determined as of 1939 the location of the thalweg as of that date. <Landman Teller>  As of that date. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Which they say is different by reason of this man-made avulsion -- <Landman Teller>  That is -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  -- on its location today. <Landman Teller>  That\\'s right. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  And they say that 19 -- it\\'s location in 1939 marked the boundary between your two States. <Landman Teller>  That -- that is what I -- that is what I understand to be their position. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, now, I don\\'t quite understand how this differs from yours. <Landman Teller>  Our position is that that thalweg is still there. That it has always been -- what we are talking about below -- below Glasscock Cutoff -- <Byron R. White>  Yes. <Landman Teller>  -- is the Mississippi River -- <Byron R. White>  But you don\\'t suggest that the thalweg in the same place today as it was in 1939. <Landman Teller>  No, I don\\'t suggest that -- <Byron R. White>  (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  -- and I wouldn\\'t suggest this going to be in the same place in this location or any other along the river next year and because the vastness of the river, there is no (Inaudible) of those with or without man-made avulsions. And the thalweg, this Court has always recognized from the earliest time in fixing what is the boundary between the State, not only in the Mississippi River but in any and every flowing stream that the mid-channel of navigation is the thought and that\\'s the very line remains the boundary. <Byron R. White>  Well, to this thing it isn\\'t very important than it is very often important to determine where the thalweg is. <Landman Teller>  Well, I think it is an old matters of jurisdiction between the States and where the -- I mean to get a distinctive or exact line, no, I guess it is a good thing that you don\\'t have to find out every -- everyday. <Byron R. White>  You\\'re just saying that we shouldn\\'t take the case because it\\'s so difficult to -- you have to take another one tomorrow and the next day. <Landman Teller>  That -- that is right and that\\'s the reason it does remain as -- as it has been a set of rule of property for all of the years since these two States have been admitted into the union and since the -- since the union of the United States has been formed and that -- and that\\'s what it almost has to be -- <Byron R. White>  But Louisiana says that -- that the State -- the ordinary rule of the thalweg shouldn\\'t apply here because the -- because the year of the area of all the cutoff really was a part of a man-made avulsion. <Landman Teller>  Well, that\\'s what they say. Now, and their own Supreme Court of -- of Louisiana said in this Esso versus Jones case that they there say that no one would make such a contention. Now, when you study that out, they just got through litigating that case and they don\\'t -- and that\\'s what the Supreme Court of Louisiana said. The Supreme Court of Louisiana pointed out in dealing with this Glasscock -- the bend way, which was admittedly within the area within the -- is bypassed by the cutoff and was within the area of the cutoff. Now, they -- they\\'ve said there that that line changed until the streams ceased to flow in the bend way. And in saying that, they pointed out, they -- they adopted the rule that this Court has announced years ago in the Lovingston case in 1874 at St. Clair County case that it didn\\'t make any difference whether this was a man-made cutoff or a natural that it was not done for the purpose of changing ownership and that the resulting effects of it did not change the boundary which remains the thalweg of the stream. Now, that\\'s the only boundary that -- if you don\\'t have that boundary would you have? What would you do? How much more confusion will result if this Court says that the -- the Mississippi River is no longer the boundary between the two streams? <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  No, no, I am not because it appears from the complaint itself on the very phase of the complaint itself that that is the issue. And if it be an issue that the thalweg itself, no -- what Mississippi says is that the thalweg of Mississippi River is the boundary. If this Court says that\\'s the only legal or permissible boundary, then there\\'s nothing to appoint a Master thought because the only dispute that could then exist would be on which side of that admitted undisputed boundary is a particular bottom-hole location of all single oil well. And that doesn\\'t present any dispute between the States. <UNK>  What you are really saying I think it was that the motion for this file has granted you would be in here on a motion for summary judgment. <Landman Teller>  That is correct and we are here now -- <UNK>  But that isn\\'t quite the issue you\\'ve gotten -- <Landman Teller>  Not -- <UNK>  -- for us. <Landman Teller>  Well, I don\\'t believe that the way Senate -- we were saying that -- that on the phase of the -- the complaint, that no cause of action has been stated for other than the thalweg remaining as it always has been the boundary within the point of Mississippi River. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  In other words, below the cut. <Landman Teller>  Below the cut. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  The thalweg maybe a shifting thalweg but there it always was and that\\'s always marked the boundary and it\\'s only within this bend where it\\'s disappeared that you have to locate the existing thalweg to fix the boundaries and if -- <Landman Teller>  You just stated much better than I do, Mr. Justice Brennan, because that\\'s what I\\'ve been trying to -- to get across to the Court that that is the only boundary that you can -- that\\'s the only line. That is the mid -- mid-channel. That is crib of the stream. And that has to be the boundary. You can have no other boundary. You can have no other division line but that thalweg. Now, if you would take this thing in map which is precisely the -- the point. If you look down at the -- at the bottom of it, there you see a meander line of 1828-1829. And you will notice -- <Byron R. White>  Now, let\\'s -- let\\'s assume for the moment -- <Landman Teller>  Alright. <Byron R. White>  -- that in 1939 and whenever does the cutoff was constructed that --within -- and it was put in the operation, it was in a month the channel of the river has shifted to the west in that 12 miles, 500 yards just from the -- just from the stream having a different speed and a different direction of the flow that -- at that point, say it had changed immediately and -- and obviously 500 yards. Now, the -- the rule would be that -- that an avulsion doesn\\'t change the boundary, is that right? <Landman Teller>  That -- that is correct. And -- and -- <Byron R. White>  Well, the streams would still be 400 -- and that it\\'d be 400 and 500 yards away. <Landman Teller>  Well, if that -- that is not true. <Byron R. White>  If in the State where it is, there would be a -- a change in thalweg just a little bit now and then but now it\\'s changed 500 yards. The river is flowing -- flowing in a -- in a different place. <Landman Teller>  There is no contention that happened. This -- this complaint alleges that in 1933, this ditch was done. This -- this -- and in 1939, it finally became sufficiently open to be the -- be carrying the mainstream of the -- of the river. Now, this area below it has always been there is no charge that -- they say that in 1939 after it became the main channel, after four years of -- of gradual open, that they should then have their -- the thalweg that then existed fixed as upon the boundary. Now, this -- this complaint also alleges that there are 15 of these cutoffs that have been made by the -- the engineers up and down the -- the -- reaches up the river. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) motion to file the complaint (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  Yes, sir. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  Yes, sir. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  That -- that is the contention and it\\'s -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  -- be denied. <Landman Teller>  We\\'ve not only denied, we say that that\\'s not legally maintained, that that\\'s a conclusion of the plea which it -- which this Court cannot -- cannot adopt and it\\'s in the position now after properly evaluating these allegations to say that they cannot adopt it because this is talking about something below the cutoff. Now, if the results -- if the resulting effects of this cutoff that -- that is if they are going to stop the processes of erosion and accretion below them, then we no longer have the Mississippi River in -- in practical effect as the boundary. You just have a lot of masters that is going out and you\\'ll have land on the Mississippi side that belongs to Louisiana of -- of the river and you\\'ll have the same thing up and down -- i mean -- <Byron R. White>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  Well, we\\'ve been here a long -- <Byron R. White>  You never will otherwise. <Landman Teller>  -- been -- been -- well after -- <Byron R. White>  What are the years? Do you know whenever those? <Landman Teller>  Well, that\\'s -- it\\'s -- it\\'s not my theory, Mr. Justice. It\\'s the theory that -- that has been existed -- <Byron R. White>  Where in this -- <Landman Teller>  -- from the very beginning that -- of -- of the jurisprudence of this country that the -- that the main mid -- mid-navigation channel of the stream is the thalweg and that is known otherwise as the thread of the stream and that furnishes the boundary. And it is capable of being ascertained at any given time that it becomes important by the (Inaudible). <Byron R. White>  That might be different tomorrow. <Landman Teller>  And it maybe different tomorrow. <Byron R. White>  If somebody drills an oil well in the middle of -- of Mississippi River that -- today it might be in Louisiana, the next day in Mississippi, the next day after that it might be shipped back and it might be -- it might just change back and forth every week. <Landman Teller>  Well, that\\'s true and -- and what happened in this case was this. After -- so, Louisiana gave a lease to this area below the cutoff, 12 Mississippi landowners gave a lease to a similar area because it had been to -- it\\'s been established by this Court in -- by Mississippi courts and also by this Court in the case of Archer versus Greenville Sand and Gravel Company that the Mississippi riparian landowner owns to the thread of the stream to the thalweg. Now, the Mississippi owners gave some leases to Humble. Humble and its subsidiary Carter got together. Now, this is in this record before you. It\\'s -- it\\'s all attached to Louisiana\\'s complaint and agreed upon a line and this is what they said and they announced the correct law and -- and so agreed. And with the Court\\'s permission, I would read from -- from the quotation from a portion of that agreement which I have -- we accorded at page 11 of our brief. It\\'s the one in blue. “Whereas Humble and Carter recognized that the boundary between the State of Mississippi and the State of Louisiana,” I\\'m talking about this area right here, “which is the community boundary between the leases owned by Humble above the scribe and the lease of Carter above the scribe is the thalweg or thread of the stream of the Mississippi, which thalweg or thread of the stream is subject to change from time to time assort to the natural action of the river and the accretion or erosion resulting there from.” And this was done in 1953, November the 25th, 1953. In consequence whereof, the boundary aforesaid separating say at least all ownerships will be subject to change. And whereas, Humble and Carter realized that the changes does occurring by natural action of the river in the thalweg or throughout the spring and consequently in the boundary between the States of Louisiana and Mississippi maybe sufficient in extent to disparage, disrupt and embarrass operations for the drilling, development and production of the lease and may give rise to operating problems. It could impede efficiency and cause loss or confusion in a sense and whereas Humble and Carter have the opinion that under these circumstances, it is the best interest of each to agree affection to each with the other. Upon an agreed value to separate their respective operational rights and ownerships so the set operating and only boundary between the parties shall remain fixed and determined, irrespective of the true boundary between the States of Louisiana and Mississippi at the present or any changes -- <Byron R. White>  That would -- that would bind neither the -- that would bind neither the land in private land over in Mississippi side or either States. <Landman Teller>  Now, that\\'s exactly our -- our position that it binds nobody. They -- they fixed -- now, they could\\'ve gone into -- to -- they could have -- they wished to have this operation line fixed as if -- as the line. They could\\'ve gone to the Zucarros, who I happen to represent in the court below. They could\\'ve gone to (Inaudible) Mississippi owns the land more to the thread of the stream. And they could\\'ve told them \"Now, this is what we are doing,\" but they didn\\'t do that. In fact, we didn\\'t know of any disagreement until the Zucarros filed a suit and -- and Humble filed it as a defensive plea in connection with the defenses in this suit. Now, that\\'s -- that\\'s the way it happened. So -- <Earl Warren>  Mr. Teller, may ask you -- <Landman Teller>  Sure. <Earl Warren>  -- this? Suppose in the District Court, suppose we did not take jurisdiction of this case and in the -- the Mississippi District Court, the Mississippi claimants lost their case, would the State of Mississippi then abandon them in acquiesce in that? <Landman Teller>  It is -- it is my understanding that -- that that would be the -- the case, that the State of Mississippi would then -- would likely exceed to their judgment and have no -- no claim. (Voice Overlap) -- <Earl Warren>  I noticed that you -- noticed that you said you represented the private plaintiffs below. <Landman Teller>  And -- and also I would\\'ve -- <Earl Warren>  Have you -- are you authorized to speak for the -- <Landman Teller>  All private -- <Earl Warren>  -- State of Louisiana (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  I\\'m a spe -- I\\'m a special of -- the Attorney General\\'s kind enough to appoint me as a special assistant in this case for this purpose and I do know that that is the position of the State of -- of Mississippi which the Attorney -- the Assistant Attorney General here will -- will vouch for me. <Earl Warren>  Would that mean anymore than that it is the opinion of the present Attorney General that that would be the situation? <Landman Teller>  I don\\'t -- I personally don\\'t believe it would mean anymore than that because I don\\'t see how you could speak to anybody voting for what he -- <Earl Warren>  Well, that\\'s what I mean. But -- but this litigation would -- they\\'d still be subject to litigation, would they not, over in -- over in Louisiana? <Landman Teller>  Well, I -- I don\\'t think that -- I think that the point is that if the thalweg is the true boundary, that there\\'s nothing that this Court will ever say or its Master could ever say but that the thalweg is the boundary. And that\\'s just as real boundary as -- as can be. It\\'s just like this Court has said, it\\'s a monument, it -- it\\'s a line. And when -- when the Court appoints the Master to fix one of these boundaries, when he gets to the thalweg, he wanted for more latitude down the thalwegs to another. Now, that\\'s what they\\'ve always done. <Earl Warren>  Aren\\'t you outguessing the Court -- what the Court might do? <Landman Teller>  I\\'m not on position -- <Earl Warren>  You say -- <Landman Teller>  -- to do so. <Earl Warren>  You say that the Court couldn\\'t do that, how do you know they couldn\\'t? <Landman Teller>  I -- I didn\\'t mean -- if I so stated, I did not mean to convey the impression that the Court could not (Voice Overlap) -- <Earl Warren>  Well, isn\\'t it bound by -- we\\'re bound by -- <Landman Teller>  By -- by -- they -- well, if -- if the -- <Earl Warren>  Yes. <Landman Teller>  -- if the thalweg is the boundary between the States, then the Court would -- could so find now that the thalweg is the boundary. <Earl Warren>  Yes. <Landman Teller>  Then there would be controversy if -- when Mississippi says that that\\'s the boundary and Louisiana says that that\\'s the boundary, they ceases to be a dispute as to where the boundary is, just like two adjoining land, as I see it. If you reach out in my brief, where the boundary goes to the creek, well -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Mr. Teller, what fact (Inaudible) in this lease? <Landman Teller>  Yes. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Several times emphasizes, recognition that the boundary may change because the thalweg changes -- <Landman Teller>  That\\'s right. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  -- to do and I\\'m referring particularly natural action of the river and accretion or erosion resulting there from. But my understanding is that the claim of Louisiana, as pleaded is, that whatever has happened to that thalweg below the foot of the cutoff, is not to natural action of the river but has been due to the man-made avulsion of -- of, namely, the cutoff just above. <Landman Teller>  I believe that is from -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, wouldn\\'t that make a different in the law (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  I don\\'t think it makes -- no, because I don\\'t think that they are privileged to make -- to -- to deliberately maintain that position because the law is, as we understand it, that whether that cutoff wasn\\'t -- wasn\\'t a natural cutoff or a man-made avulsion if it does not change anything except the area within the avulsion itself. It does not result to change. Now, there was testimony -- <Byron R. White>  But in that effect said that this land below is within the avulsion. <Landman Teller>  Well, it is not. <Byron R. White>  Because there is a -- the assertion is that there was -- there -- as I understand it, at least that within their assertion -- their assertion includes the proposition or the possibility that there was a radical change below the cut which was part and parcel of the man-made avulsion. <Landman Teller>  Well, of course, that would have to be a -- it will have to be dissolved by evidence and held -- <Byron R. White>  That is -- <Landman Teller>  -- held. <Byron R. White>  -- the point. <Landman Teller>  -- that -- that\\'s how -- how radical that change was -- <Byron R. White>  That\\'s the main point. <Landman Teller>  Well -- which we -- but -- but we don\\'t -- it\\'s -- it\\'s not -- it -- it is nevertheless, is -- is not the -- if -- they don\\'t charge that it was a change that -- that the change itself was not imperceptible. They don\\'t charge that plainly or unequivocally and they don\\'t mean to charge it because they\\'re not going to prove that it wasn\\'t -- actually, it didn\\'t get to -- to where it is today until 1954, which was some 20 years after the original cutoff. And they do not charge that anywhere. It\\'s their duty to charge that plainly and unequivocally in their complaint. They do not do that. They simply said that -- that any changes, no matter how -- how they may be, how imperceptible they may be, all the results of the avulsion, they do not charge that the -- that the change which we -- <Byron R. White>  Even there was a radical change, he wouldn\\'t be making his argument, is that right? <Landman Teller>  Well, I would still be making the argument that -- that the -- that you still have to go. But, in other words, you don\\'t have a boundary within a boundary, that the Mississippi River is itself the boundary. And it always has been below that. And if the thalweg itself shifted in there, no one is going to see if it did shift within that boundary that it would still remain that it has to remain the -- the exact line which divides the two jurisdictions as to boundaries. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) never the law even if it did (Inaudible) in that effect. <Landman Teller>  Well, they -- they -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  They say that the change occurred as the direct result of the cutoff but they don\\'t say to what period of time that change occurred. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  Well -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  But the point is, they don\\'t -- do not say that that movement in the thalweg below Glasscock was itself a precipitous nature at all. They -- they do not purport to say that. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  But your argument before (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  Well, I would even then -- I would -- I would still think that the Mississippi River would remain the boundary and that the thalweg in that river as it existed and as that river may change, would necessarily continue to be the boundary. And I think that -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  Yes, sir. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  What the (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  Well, I think that the -- that the -- in St. Clair County versus Lovingston. <Hugo L. Black>  St. Clair County versus Lovingston. <Landman Teller>  Lovingston. <UNK>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  That\\'s 23 wall, page 46. It\\'s -- it is cited in our supple -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  Well, no -- no, it -- it involves a man-made ditch, which would -- will argue this having changed of the boundary. It -- it\\'s the same thing. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  It is from the (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  46. And of course, they are just innumerable annotations on that same subject, which we have cited in our -- in our supplemental brief in -- in one study, they are. I believe it is. But -- <Hugo L. Black>  As to the next page, for that to whom -- <Landman Teller>  130 -- <Hugo L. Black>  -- who own the accretion, is it what you (Inaudible) <Landman Teller>  That\\'s right and this is the -- this is the same thing because the accretions are going to be -- <Hugo L. Black>  What do you think is the difference between your -- Mississippi and Louisiana, any? <Landman Teller>  I really don\\'t think there is. I think that it\\'s not a -- <Hugo L. Black>  In other words, you think there\\'s no controversy between you at all? <Landman Teller>  Well, this is the reason we say that. <Hugo L. Black>  Where is this land? <Landman Teller>  The -- the land is in the bottom of the bed of Mississippi River. <Hugo L. Black>  But is it in Mississippi or Louisiana? <Landman Teller>  Well, now, it\\'s -- it\\'s not a question whether -- whether the land is (Voice Overlap) -- <Hugo L. Black>  Which one do you claim it stands? <Landman Teller>  We claim the oil well is now on the Mississippi side of the thalweg. <Hugo L. Black>  Now, why do you claim it\\'s there? <Landman Teller>  Because thalweg is west of that. <Hugo L. Black>  Because the thalweg is -- <Landman Teller>  Is west of the bottom-hole -- <Hugo L. Black>  Is it always -- is it always been west of that? <Landman Teller>  Since -- since the well was drilled in 1954 according to -- <Hugo L. Black>  Whose have been paying taxes to the -- <Landman Teller>  Louisiana. <Hugo L. Black>  Louisiana. Has it been paying in the Mississippi? <Landman Teller>  No. <Hugo L. Black>  Have they ever paid any tax to Mississippi on that land -- <Landman Teller>  Never. <Hugo L. Black>  -- during all the history of the (Voice Overlap)? <Landman Teller>  Not -- not during the time that the oil well has been drilled. It was a directionally drilled oil well. <Hugo L. Black>  They claim that -- there\\'s been a shift due to the man-made avulsions, is it not? <Landman Teller>  That -- that is -- that there\\'s a shifting -- <Hugo L. Black>  What do you say about that? <Landman Teller>  We -- we say that the -- that the thalweg that is the boundary -- <Hugo L. Black>  Do you say there has been a shift of it or not? <Landman Teller>  There has been a gradual -- there has been a shift and -- <Hugo L. Black>  Caused by what, do you say? <Landman Teller>  It\\'s due to the operation of the river. There have been causes as the result of the avu -- avulsion. <Hugo L. Black>  Do you agree with them it is caused by an avulsion, man-made avulsion? <Landman Teller>  No. <Hugo L. Black>  You do not? <Landman Teller>  Well, now, in this sense, we may agree that -- that that is what changed the -- the way the river was running. And -- and I dare say that --- that experts will readily testify, that had that change not been made. The -- that the channel -- main channel may have continued more to the west -- more to the east than it did. We can conceive that that evidence would be readily forthcoming but that does not change the boundary, which is the Mississippi River, and which is the main channel navigation in there. <Hugo L. Black>  But it did change the Mississippi River itself, do you say? <Landman Teller>  No. <Hugo L. Black>  Didn\\'t you say it shifted? <Landman Teller>  Well -- well, not specifically. I don\\'t -- I know of no shift in the river (Inaudible) in occasion. <Hugo L. Black>  How does it happen that Mississippi is claiming land now but didn\\'t claim before 1954? <Landman Teller>  Well, in -- I don\\'t -- I guess that Mississippi is in the sense that the Zucarros have ascertained -- <Hugo L. Black>  Alright, what -- <Landman Teller>  The same thing, because -- because that -- the channel of navigation is now to the west, all west -- <Hugo L. Black>  Channel of navigation is now to the west? <Landman Teller>  To the west. <Hugo L. Black>  Caused by what? <Landman Teller>  Just the -- I guess it could\\'ve bee -- suppose it did result from the -- <Hugo L. Black>  Do you claim that the -- the channel changing has given the land to the Zucarros because it\\'s non-Mississippi? <Landman Teller>  It\\'s within -- the -- the land is now -- that the well is the bottom-hole of that well is now in Mississippi. <Hugo L. Black>  And they claim that it didn\\'t -- never has been in Mississippi. <Landman Teller>  That\\'s right. <Hugo L. Black>  And it\\'s not yet and that there has been no shift to the river that gives it to Mississippi. <Landman Teller>  They -- they claim that the -- that the (Inaudible) fixed as it was in 1939 where the main channel was at that time. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Mr. Teller, don\\'t you have to say that sure, there\\'s been a shift in -- in favor of Mississippi but if the shift through the natural action of the river and Louisiana says it is not, it\\'s a shift due to this cutoff man-made avulsion and therefore, the ordinary rule which would give you the benefit if it were due to natural action of the river doesn\\'t apply but the old location of the thalweg determined whether it\\'s Louisiana or Mississippi and why isn\\'t that a controversy between the two? <Landman Teller>  Because of this, we say that there has been a shift. We say that the river remains a boundary. <Landman Teller>  And it had made no difference why that shift in the thalweg occurred from a natural avulsion or a man-made avulsion, that the thalweg, as it changed, change the state boundary with it, so that the shift was a natural shift in the -- in the state boundary. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, that\\'s a question of law, isn\\'t it? <Landman Teller>  I don\\'t think so. I think it is a question -- <Byron R. White>  (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  -- yes, I think it is a question of law, that\\'s what I mean. <Byron R. White>  (Voice Overlap) minimum that it\\'s a question of law, is it not? <Landman Teller>  What? That\\'s a question of law which -- <Byron R. White>  And it maybe that you have to have -- if the -- if the questions were decided in certain ways, maybe you\\'ll have to have a fact. <Landman Teller>  Well, I don\\'t think so because I think it that the -- the complaint is so clear in -- in its recitation that all of this occurred in the bed of the river that all -- <Byron R. White>  Do you say -- do you say that conceding -- conceding that the river shifted due to the man-made avulsion nevertheless as a matter of law? <Landman Teller>  That\\'s exactly our position. <Byron R. White>  Yes. <Landman Teller>  And that the thalweg is the boundary -- has been the boundary and will remain the boundary. <Hugo L. Black>  Do you say that the shifted thalweg remains the boundary? <Landman Teller>  Yes, that\\'s right. <Hugo L. Black>  Wherever it go? <Landman Teller>  Wherever it go. <Hugo L. Black>  Year to year? <Landman Teller>  From year to year, from day to day, from time to time. <Hugo L. Black>  Even if it\\'s done by a man? <Landman Teller>  If it\\'s done -- if it -- yes, if -- if the resulting effect above or below it is done by a man, yes, as long as that bend of the stream remains the boundary that that shifting thalweg remains (Voice Overlap). <Hugo L. Black>  Well, I -- what else would make in the principle as to whether it\\'s above or below if the river came to the question of whether it\\'s changed by a man or artificially. <Byron R. White>  Well, you would say that we get the same result, the same question as supposed that a man didn\\'t make this avulsion but it is occurred naturally. <Landman Teller>  I think the same question would be posed and I -- I don\\'t -- I think the same answer would -- would have to result that the thalweg in Mississippi River as it existed below the -- the area of the avulsion, no matter -- whether somebody could\\'ve find or not to find as it came (Voice Overlap). <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, I -- I may suggest, Mr. Teller, I would suppose then that if procedure means much in these cases have -- doesn\\'t mean as much that uses that -- your tactic is not an opposition to the motions were filed but rather let them file on a motion to the solicited complaint on the ground it doesn\\'t state the cause of action. <Landman Teller>  Well, as we understand it, that -- that it is -- that it\\'s true but we understand that\\'s the -- why I say it\\'s a reason that you dismissed the complaint. That\\'s what the Court did in Massachusetts. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  You mean why -- why -- that\\'s the reason why we refused to accept. <Landman Teller>  Or refused to -- to let them file. That was done in Massachusetts -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  It may be -- <Landman Teller>  -- versus Missouri. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  -- may be -- yes. <Landman Teller>  And in looking at it, it was -- it does not state the cause of action then that is a ground for declining to permit the complaint to be filed and that\\'s what this Court has done consistently in -- in -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  In this two, you said all you want to state in support of the motion to dismiss if you had filed one. <Landman Teller>  Yes, that -- that\\'s all I could say. I couldn\\'t say anything more on -- on the ground that it states no cause of action. Now, we do say this that there is no controversy between the State with relation to where that well is because now the Zucarros had sued Humble Oil Company. They\\'re asking not in the work of Louisiana. The fact that Humble has elected to suspend its royalty payments to Louisiana is -- is not a -- a reason for this Court to assume jurisdiction. If -- if Humble is supposed to pay Louisiana, all Louisiana has to do is to sue Humble in its own courts, any -- as it may elect. And where this well -- suppose the location is -- <Hugo L. Black>  Well, wouldn\\'t it still depend on who -- where the river is, where the land was in Mississippi or Louisiana, wouldn\\'t that be the crucial issue to go up? <Landman Teller>  I think it\\'s -- I think that the boundary is a crucial issue. One -- if you -- if you say this Court was to decide that the boundary is the thalweg as it now exist, then that leaves no dispute about the boundary or I will say the well -- then it\\'s just a matter of -- of ascertaining a fact but this Court doesn\\'t have to take jurisdiction or wouldn\\'t take jurisdiction. I shouldn\\'t think you undertake to find as to where that directionally drilled well, where it is found. If its west of this undisputed thalweg, well, it\\'s in Louisiana, that\\'s the end of it. I mean, that\\'s a -- that\\'s a mathematical or ascertainable fact. We are here if its east of that thalweg, then what difference would it make to Louisiana? It\\'s like -- you should be not so for me what care I have for you\\'d be but -- <Hugo L. Black>  The difference of that in Illinois well (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  Well, that maybe true but -- but it -- it would do -- it would -- that -- that would be so but it wouldn\\'t present a dispute with the State of Mississippi because Mississippi has taken nothing from Louisiana. <Hugo L. Black>  (Inaudible) isn\\'t it? <Landman Teller>  No, I don\\'t -- now, the Zuccaros are private citizens filed this complaint for a self-surfaced trespass and -- and that\\'s what they say activated this cause of action but they are saying -- <Earl Warren>  Will the State of Mississippi get royalties if -- if your people win? <Landman Teller>  They would get no royalties because they have no ownership. They would get severance taxes and -- <Earl Warren>  Yes, severance taxes and -- <Landman Teller>  -- they would. <Earl Warren>  Yes. <Landman Teller>  And they -- they would have -- <Earl Warren>  They\\'d have -- they\\'d have (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  And they would then -- they would then be within -- begin to regulate no (Voice Overlap) -- <Earl Warren>  (Voice Overlap) -- <Landman Teller>  -- well and there would be a -- a problem of -- of the fact that the well was in Mississippi which would mean if it the (Inaudible) win the case, no doubt, they will make every such contention such as that. That well is in Mississippi, should be -- and royalty and severance taxes should be paid and -- and the like. I don\\'t think there\\'s any question but that -- that would -- would follow. But that presents no dispute with the -- with Louisiana between -- I mean the claim would be against Humble, it wouldn\\'t be against Louisiana. And if -- if we found the boundary -- if we once (Voice Overlap) -- <Hugo L. Black>  Suppose that half of Mississippi -- suppose it would half Mississippi instead of just being this much, I mean half of Louisiana. You would have a title -- <Landman Teller>  You -- you mean -- if -- if the -- if the river -- <Earl Warren>  -- if the river to the State and you say, “Well, that doesn\\'t dispute between landowners”. <Landman Teller>  Well, I don\\'t think it -- I mean once the boundary is at stake, then the consequences of the -- <Hugo L. Black>  So that you say it shifts along with the thalweg. <Landman Teller>  Well, that\\'s right but -- but -- once if -- if the Court -- if this Court determines that that\\'s the boundary, then the consequences which broken my determination, no matter how much it involved, would just -- would just certainly fall in place as I see it. That -- if that\\'s the boundary, that fixes that part of the property. And -- and that, in our view, is the -- if -- is that -- you don\\'t say that there is no dispute about the boundary and that the other matters, without that boundary dispute, do not present a case that justiciable conquest between the States or one which this Court should take jurisdiction of. <Hugo L. Black>  If the Court permits the file, are you objecting the saying if the (Inaudible) influence? <Landman Teller>  Yes, we are. <Hugo L. Black>  Why? <Landman Teller>  Because we see -- well, actually, I get the practical consequence of that would be that the parties migrate because it\\'s going to be expensive to these private landowners to -- to try this litigation. But I don\\'t know of any reason why the Court would -- would want to stay in each proceedings, involving of a -- a disputed claim between the Zucarros on the one hand and Humble Oil Company on the other, especially when Humble says that they agreed upon the boundary which was not the state line and as a condition to that agreement, as you will read, they were cited in -- <Hugo L. Black>  Does that lawsuit depend on where the -- other the lands in Mississippi or Louisiana? <Landman Teller>  Oh, absolutely -- it depends. They would have that -- <Hugo L. Black>  Where it depends on? <Landman Teller>  As a -- as a condition to recover. They would have to prove that they own this land and that this -- this oil company can\\'t directionally drill the well underneath their land and extracted their oil. They have to subs that tre -- trespass and as an -- and they\\'re see -- seeking a monetary judgment from Humble thalweg. Now, there\\'s just one of the thing that I want (Voice Overlap) -- <Hugo L. Black>  Crucial issue being whether it\\'s in Louisiana or Mississippi. <Landman Teller>  That -- it would even go to the jurisdiction. I don\\'t think there\\'s any question about that and they\\'ve raised all kinds or forms and would have to be -- the -- the -- but I think it would fall -- that the case would rise or fall on that determination. <UNK>  That\\'s where they -- <Landman Teller>  And I might point out that Humble agreed on this arbitrary line with its subsidiary (Inaudible). They recognized that several units that they have been informed with the State Oil and Gas Board who are then west of this line. <Byron R. White>  Has there been any suggestion that Mississippi and Louisiana has any kind of conversation about a settlement of this case or about it? <Landman Teller>  Well, my -- my associates won\\'t take it up right now but they didn\\'t -- Mississippi didn\\'t even know the -- the suit was going to be filed until they got processed. So they couldn\\'t -- so there wasn\\'t any (Inaudible) Thank you very much. <Earl Warren>  Mr. McLendon. <Martin R. McLendon>  Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court. As we understand the issue present before the Court, it\\'s on a motion of the State of Louisiana to file or be permitted to file a complaint, an original action. And as we understand, we are to take that complaint as it is written and apply the law as this Court has written it to the facts as they are undisputed. Now, to begin with, I think that what the Court said in Arkansas versus Texas is material to this particular observation in determining -- the Court said this, \"In determining whether the interest being litigated is an appropriate one for the exercise of a reasonable jurisdiction, we, of course, look behind and beyond the legal form in which the claim of the State is pressed. We determine whether the claim is that of the State, whether the State is indeed the real party in interest. We think it has been amply covered but we want to restate it for emphasis. We think that the complaint in this case does not comply with that rule because there\\'s no charge that the State of Mississippi is or has been or is attempting to deprive the State of Louisiana of anything. <Hugo L. Black>  Well, is it? <Martin R. McLendon>  It is not. <Hugo L. Black>  Why -- why is Mississippi defending? <Martin R. McLendon>  We will may defend it, Your Honor and as (Voice Overlap) -- <Hugo L. Black>  Depending on the ground that it\\'s in Mississippi? <Martin R. McLendon>  We will defend -- may defend it on -- based upon the ground of the citizens of Mississippi who had sued a lessee of the State of Louisiana because of peculiarities of the two -- the law of the two States, the Law of Louisiana being the -- the State owns, as trustee for the people, the bed of the navigable stream, whereas the Louisiana, the abiding property owner owns the bed of the stream to the boundary line. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  If the Court please, I support the contention of my colleague that the thalweg -- the thalweg, as it\\'s been called, is the boundary line between the States at the point in question. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, this engineer, this is the navigational chart, that the only river pallet is used. They follow -- I think they follow that red line that is the thalweg, the main channel. According to the engineer, the place is on there, the oil well and the abiding property of the Zuccaro goes out to that river stream and not exactly into the lower -- the property goes to that point. Now -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  If it is determined that -- that it is on the eastern of the thalweg, yes, sir. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  Yes, sir. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  Is that correct? <Martin R. McLendon>  Yes, sir. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) is that correct? <Martin R. McLendon>  Yes, sir. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  Now, that -- that I want to get into that, if the Court please, in just a minute. I want to explain that it\\'s our understanding, I don\\'t think it\\'s been probably brought out here today. But I want to explain it with -- if I may get to that point (Inaudible). Louisiana as the lessor has been receiving royalty payments. They regulate the production and receive taxes.Mississippi had not attempted to regulate production or anything else. Now, this Court has held that its original-jurisdiction was in controversies between States was a good substitute for diplomacy and war between nations, peculiar to our federal system. And, of course, in two cases that I have referenced to, war or armed conflict was narrowly averted, that is Louisiana versus Mississippi and Oklahoma versus Texas, Oklahoma versus Texas having to do with oil well, Louisiana versus Mississippi having to do with oyster fishing rights. We have pointed out, we think, that Mississippi is not presently attempting to assert any jurisdiction over this particular property. Now, with the Court\\'s permission, we want to take issue or something that Mr. Carmouche said a minute ago and that there\\'s a presumption of bias on the part of the jury. We -- we respectfully reject that contention and now ask the Court to disregard it. We think it\\'s offensive to our jury system as it exist. And of course, as Justice Goldberg pointed out, that we -- if the -- if it is finally determined that this oil well is in Mississippi, we intend to exercise jurisdiction. Now, the avulsion which was caused by the United States Corps of Engineers joining this cutoff here is that cutoff as it is now. This is the map in 1930 and 1940-41. This is a map of 1962. The cutoff leads (Inaudible) bend way. And this became the main channel of the stream. On each side of this river, because of that avulsion, the State of Mississippi to this (Inaudible). The boundary line goes all up here. That is the remaining boundary and continues to be the boundary under the law of this Court as it was established because that was an avulsion and avulsive cutoff immediate and so that something remained on the other side of the river. Now, down here where this property is located, the (Inaudible) there is almost (Inaudible). This shift has been gradual and imperceptible and this Court has held that -- that is a natural right, I believe they used the word “natural right\\' it -- because he who stands to gain by an accretion is not law -- responsible to anyone for because he could not recover for his loss by an erosion. Now, that was what -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  Natural and imperceptible. But it does not necessarily have to be natural according to St. Clair County versus Lovingston. In that case, as long as -- <UNK>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  -- as long as it\\'s gradual and the party claiming the benefit is not liable and did not construct the artificial (Inaudible). In that case, the City of St. Louis had built a dike out. And the water had accreted around behind it. And this Court said, following the old common law, that so long as the particular individual who was claiming the benefit of that accretion had not caused it, he was -- he was entitled to receive the benefit side. And of course, the rule we\\'re talking about is that accretions belong to the abiding property. <Hugo L. Black>  That was the accretion of -- on the soil -- <Martin R. McLendon>  Yes, sir. <John L. Madden>  -- back to the stream. <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s right, yes. <Hugo L. Black>  And they said that the man owning the property next to it was like an owner of flocks and herbs, that they\\'re entitled to the natural inquiry. <Martin R. McLendon>  Natural inquiry. <Hugo L. Black>  But this they claim is not natural inquiry. <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, that I think -- <Hugo L. Black>  They claim that this is due to man-made work. <Martin R. McLendon>  That -- if the Court please, we submit and Mr. Goldberg read the particular point, paragraph 17 of the complaint, we submit is the conclusion of the pleader. <Hugo L. Black>  That\\'s what the -- of course, he concludes something when they alleged it, aren\\'t they? <Martin R. McLendon>  Well -- <Hugo L. Black>  What they\\'re alleging is that this is a man-made work in this file question. You might say that we would make them tell on how -- what men did and going to details about when he did it and who did it and how much he paid for it but after all, what they alleged is it\\'s a man-made job, don\\'t they? <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, they allege, if the Court please, that the man-made avulsion between points (a) and point (b) on this map, holds that there are accretions down here and because of this avulsion to point (b) that it should -- that it effected and changed the property ownership down to this point and we admit that it changed the property ownership here and changed the boundary between the State. But we say at point (b) at the foot of that cutoff and this is mass made by -- under the direction of the President of Mississippi River Commission. We think the Court can take judicial knowledge of the fact that the particular problem in this complaint or involved in this point is below the cutoff, outside of the area that was changed by avulsion. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  Well -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s right. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  Well -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  -- if -- if -- <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Martin R. McLendon>  If the Court please, the -- you have anticipated me once more and we\\'re going to get to that point. We think that if the Court follows the rule that it first announced, in (Inaudible) versus Illinois and continues to adhere to the fact and the latest -- latest expression concerning, it was in Mississippi versus Louisiana 300 U.S. and continues to maintain that in areas like this, the live thalweg is the boundary line. Now, that has been followed in every case involving States boarding upon navigable streams, the Missouri and the Mississippi River. On Missouri versus Kentucky, Louisiana versus Mississippi, Arkansas versus Mississippi and Tennessee and all other States up and down the river, this live thalweg, this channel that the river both kept and feud because it is followed, the main channel of the stream, as I understand that\\'s a German word and it\\'s been used worldwide as -- where live streams or boundaries between States. Now, this Court in the last case that it had between these two States, used the live thalweg and the dead thalweg as in preference to metes and bounds descriptions. It would use a metes and bounds description to the point where the river still flowed or whether it had ceased to flow but was still un -- underwater and they would use the dead thalweg or the live thalweg around in preference to metes and bounds. And the -- the best this Court could do would be establish metes and bounds and this Court has heretofore use live and dead thalweg in preference to metes and bounds. They asked the Court to mark this boundary from here to here. And if the Court adheres to the rule that the live thalweg is still the boundary, we submit that it is not a question of fact because there\\'s no dispute that was back to your question Justice -- Mr. Justice Goldberg, there was no dispute between the two States because the live thalweg is as definite as appositive and easily as determination as the edge of this desk of the -- <Hugo L. Black>  May I ask you -- because I -- I\\'ve just read the -- this case of yours that you referred to. You referred to the live thalweg, alright, you\\'d mean the new one after the stream shifted. That\\'s what you\\'d mean by the live one is it or the Deadman? <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, I mean by the Deadman, this area that goes up to here, the live thalweg as to where the water has flown since -- flowed down the river. <Hugo L. Black>  In what case -- what case of this Court has held, that\\'s the one I was concern in here, could -- <Martin R. McLendon>  Yes, sir. <Hugo L. Black>  -- you tell me? Has held that where the thalweg has changed by reason of man avulsion or man\\'s work, artificial work that the boundary of the States also says with that -- to go along with the new thalweg? What case of this Court tells that? <Martin R. McLendon>  I don\\'t believe I understand your question, Mr. Justice. <Hugo L. Black>  I mean this. The cases have held unless changed by reason of the natural ebb and flow of the tide, the natural change within the stream, man had nothing to do with it that the thalweg, being where the thalweg -- the boundary, continues to be the boundary where the shifting changes of the stream, can you tell? <Martin R. McLendon>  Yes. <Hugo L. Black>  Well, what case has held is -- does the new thalweg that becomes the boundary, if the new thalweg is caused by shifting of the stream with man produced? <Martin R. McLendon>  If I made to you that impression, Your Honor, I had no intention of doing so. The new thalweg, as I\\'ve pointed out from point (a) to point (b), Mississippi is on this side and Mississippi is on that side that the boundary between the two States continues to go up here because this was an avulsive change down here, below point (b) during these areas they asked to be governed in this matter, that is the old and continuing channel of the river. It has merely shifted by reason, I think everyone can see, by reason of the fact that the -- of the Glasscock Cutoff being done. <Hugo L. Black>  That\\'s right. They alleged that in your brief and that\\'s a man\\'s work and yet you say that the -- that the boundary shifts with the shifting of the thalweg (Voice Overlap) -- <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, if the Court please, may I -- may -- <Hugo L. Black>  And I just read your opinion that County of St. Clair and I just don\\'t see where it says that at all. Now, is there any other case that proceed to it in there? <Martin R. McLendon>  If the court please, I -- I still have not -- I have not attempted to represent to this Court that the -- an avulsive change changes the boundary between the States. I have only attempted to represent that an accretion -- an accretive change changes with the -- the river. The river goes with it. <Hugo L. Black>  They say this is not accretive within the technical artistic meaning of that word. They say its change brought about by a man-made avulsion.(Voice Overlap) -- <Martin R. McLendon>  They say that the -- they say that any change from this point down to here is brought about by this man-made avulsion. And we say that the continuing -- the live thalweg, as it goes to down here all the way to here, according to St. (Voice Overlap) -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, really what they say, Mr. McLendon, in 17 is, this -- isn\\'t it, that surely it\\'s accretive below the cutoff but nevertheless, it\\'s accretive due to avulsion because they say the Glasscock Cutoff being man-made is a close natural mean and avulsive at any event. As I understand it means that even if accretive below, that that\\'s brought on the change in the location of thalweg. Nevertheless, that accretion is due to an avulsive action whether man-made or natural, I don\\'t care. <Martin R. McLendon>  And that -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  And as I read 17 -- <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s -- <Byron R. White>  And you say -- and you say that as long as it\\'s accretive below the cutoff, it cannot -- that -- that the thalweg still marked the -- <UNK>  The boundary. <Byron R. White>  -- the boundary. <Martin R. McLendon>  That is our understanding of -- <Byron R. White>  As long as it\\'s accretive, no matter as if this result from the cutoff. <Martin R. McLendon>  That\\'s right. <Byron R. White>  Yes. <Martin R. McLendon>  We think that that -- <Hugo L. Black>  That\\'s what I\\'m asking if you had any case besides to the St. Clair case. <Martin R. McLendon>  Well, the only case we -- <Hugo L. Black>  (Voice Overlap) -- <Martin R. McLendon>  -- we have that is that the case is with this particular point. I\\'m not certain it has come up except in the Louisiana Supreme Court case but we have cases, a continual line of cases where this Court has held that the live thalweg is and continuous to remain the boundary between the States. <Hugo L. Black>  Yes, that\\'s correct, when is the live thalweg is brought about by consensuses of nature in shifting the stream. <Martin R. McLendon>  Well we -- the -- if there\\'s a factual issue in this view. <Hugo L. Black>  We\\'re asking the Court to take judicial notice -- notice of this map and note that the -- the Glasscock Cutoff areas here and we can see the changes in state boundary was made but the thalweg continued to be the boundary here and that is what they\\'re asking the Court to change a -- to setup a new rule of law. <Martin R. McLendon>  As we understand, the -- we have laid too long on this particular point we think because our time is gone but we won\\'t point out again the cases. We submit that Louisiana is not a prop -- <Earl Warren>  You may take a couple of minutes more to -- to state your point. <Martin R. McLendon>  It was American conclusion by way of conclusion, Your Honor. We wanted to point out that this Court, heretofore, in examining such type -- the cases of this type, New Hampshire versus Louisiana. Louisiana, I mean New York versus Louisiana and Massachusetts versus Missouri where the real interest, where the Court as if followed it through and looked through the form of the complaint to the real interest applied the law as it head theretofore written it and came up with the conclusion that the parties and interest were individual citizens and not States and that the States stood nothing to gain or nothing to lose has seemed fit to -- to dismiss those cases or to decline to permit them to be filed. We -- by way of complete summary want to say that we don\\'t think or submit to the Court that the complaint states a justiciable controversy between these two States as we understand the opinions by this Court. I want to personally thank and thank from the State of Mississippi the Court for (Inaudible) and receptive here. Thank you. <Earl Warren>  Mr. Carmouche. <Edward M. Carmouche>  Thank you. Your Honors may I answer the last question posed to me before beginning my refutation. The question was should the proceedings in the United States District Court be stayed. We think definitely, yes. I do not agree with Mississippi\\'s assertion in their argument in their brief that protest should be something like the case of Louisiana versus Mississippi where there was eminent danger on conflict. I do not believe that we have to convince this Honorable Court that there\\'s a possibility of a war between Louisiana and Mississippi for this Court to have jurisdiction over boundary dispute. That is possibly the maximum situation. But we believe the test should be as in the case of Mississippi versus Louisiana in 1955 when this Court found that there was a boundary dispute. The one in question asked there whether it was substantial or whether Louisiana wanted to exercise jurisdiction at that time, the question was simply pointed out that there was a dispute between the two States as to where the thalweg was. In that case, we were dealing with accretions. The Court held that they were imperceptible and gradual and therefore reached a different conclusion -- <Byron R. White>  But don\\'t you -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  -- but -- <Byron R. White>  Would you -- would you agree here that you have that case as to the Court held that any accretive change is -- is -- does change the boundary? <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, sir. What I\\'m saying here, the only question before this Court is there a dispute? It is for a Master to determine what kind of change has taken place and whether we own it or whether a -- <Byron R. White>  That -- that is the -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  -- recipient -- <Byron R. White>  --point. Let\\'s assume that it was determined that there was an accretive change here. <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, sir. <Byron R. White>  That as a matter of law, any accretive change whether caused by avulsion or not changes the boundary. <Edward M. Carmouche>  I think we would still -- <Byron R. White>  That is the matter before us. <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, sir, I think we still have some issues. And I would like -- <Byron R. White>  What? <Edward M. Carmouche>  -- to point them out. We drill this -- first, let me say that I do not like the idea of Mississippi putting words in our mouth and saying that we\\'re standing on the proposition that the thalweg is, in 1939, is as it should be established. Our position in our brief was that if this is an avulsive situation, we should take the thalweg as it existed immediately prior to the avulsion. Now, in 1932, they began the work on this cutoff. In 1939, they finished it, but it still was not effective. The engineers couldn\\'t get water to go through it. They couldn\\'t divert that -- that curb. And so, they went back in and bridged it again and it was not until 1950 that actually the cutoff became fully effective. So, that leads us to this issue. If the thalweg is the boundary, what is the critical date for the establishment of this thalweg? Is it as we find it today? Is it as we find it at the time the Zuccaros filed their suit? <Byron R. White>  And is that -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Is it -- <Byron R. White>  -- is -- is that acceptable as cutoff, you would say from day to day is the right time? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Correct, yes, sir. <Byron R. White>  But now you say, the -- that the -- that the cutoff makes all the difference -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  It is a law. <Byron R. White>  -- even though there\\'s only accretive change involved. <Edward M. Carmouche>  We -- we don\\'t say that it was accretion. We said it was avulsion which is the opposite -- <Byron R. White>  (Voice Overlap) you say it\\'s accretion as a result of an avulsion which makes it an avulsion in your -- in your word. <Edward M. Carmouche>  I -- I think that Mississippi has confused us here. Accretion means a building up of land by gradual and imperceptible process. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, the words -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  I dont\\'t -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  -- you used is any movement. Of course, you mean that -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  -- the movement of the thalweg. <Edward M. Carmouche>  I don\\'t believe that there\\'s been any change in land at all. There\\'s no new land on our side of the bank and no new land on the Mississippi side of the bank. The current has changed to where the main current, the deepest part of the river is shifting westward. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, if they\\'re right, there\\'s an accretion to the land owned by the riparian owners by reason of the shift of the thalweg, isn\\'t it? <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, there\\'s still water there. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Maybe but as (Voice Overlap) -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  There\\'s still water -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  -- the accretion to that land? <Edward M. Carmouche>  If we\\'re speaking of it -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  You have to -- <Byron R. White>  But (Voice Overlap) on the Mississippi side? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Sir? <Byron R. White>  There\\'s an accretion on the Mississippi side as it occurring (Voice Overlap) -- <UNK>  It has to be. <Edward M. Carmouche>  If we\\'re speaking in terms of the thalweg, yes, sir. If we\\'re speaking of -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, you used the word “movement” anyway, is it? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, sir. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  But what do you mean over at 17, as I read you correctly is, saying what I suggested, the adversary you meant, the Glasscock Cutoff being man-made as opposed to natural means and avulsive in any event? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, sir. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  What do you mean by that? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Well, the Lovingston case, as they pointed out, said that accretions whether man-made or natural, if imperceptible will set the thalweg in the middle of the main channel. Now, we are saying that this is an avulsive action, first. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  That caused the movement of it. <Edward M. Carmouche>  And second that it was perceptible which takes us out of the -- <Byron R. White>  You -- you\\'d say that the change wasn\\'t avul -- wasn\\'t accretive at all -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Right. <Byron R. White>  -- below the cutoff? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Right. <Byron R. White>  (Voice Overlap) the avulsive change itself (Voice Overlap) -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  That\\'s right. And further, that it must meet the test of the imperceptibility and gradually which this does not mean a dredge, which is picking up more than a ton of earth in a time, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be construed as gradual and imperceptible. You can see it. This Court held in the very case that were cited by our opponents, St. Clair versus Lovingston, the task as to what is gradual and imperceptible is that, although the witnesses may see from time to time that progress has been made. They could not perceive it while the process was going on. It is imperceptible. <Earl Warren>  Well Mr. -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  In other words, it\\'s what can be seen. <Earl Warren>  Mr. Carmouche, I have -- I understand that the cutoff was not completed and was not thoroughly useful until 1950, is that right? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, Your Honor. <Earl Warren>  How much of a change are we talking about now? We -- we\\'ve been talking a lot about whether it was a gradual imperceptible accretion or not, how much of a change is there in the -- in the thalweg in this very neighborhood that we\\'re talking about? <Edward M. Carmouche>  I would say over a thousand feet, Your Honor. <Earl Warren>  Over a thousand feet. <Edward M. Carmouche>  And it\\'s continuing to move to the west. Now, we certainly -- that movement has been a myth. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Have the banks in the river changed there or just the thalweg? <Edward M. Carmouche>  The thalweg. <Byron R. White>  Banks, not the banks at all? <Edward M. Carmouche>  No, not to my knowledge. Of course, that\\'s a question for the merits. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  How wise the (Inaudible) this? Why -- <Byron R. White>  Its quite -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Why? <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, Your Honor, why is it here? Of course, it\\'s (Inaudible) <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  Well, don\\'t take your time. (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, it\\'s -- it\\'s over a mile, I would say. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  Our courts would testify before our Master from 12 to 15 miles and we think that all of that is avulsive, not just where they the cut and that is the opposite. <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  Sir? <Arthur J. Goldberg>  (Inaudible) <Edward M. Carmouche>  No (Inaudible) another bend and that it gets back into its natural current. Now, we think that this boundary dispute -- dispute exist and that the controversy between the parties is real and substantial. We do not think that we should be forced to submit ourselves to the jurisdiction of the Mississippi jury to determine our eastern boundary. We do not think that even if we did submit ourselves to the jurisdiction of this Mississippi case that we would solve anything because Mississippi is not a party and it would not be bound by that decision. And until you have both States bound, you cannot determine this boundary. Now, the issue was brought home very clearly by Mr. Justice Black\\'s questions to my opponent. He said, “Is this well located in the State of Mississippi or in Louisiana?” And they said it was located in Mississippi. We contend in our complaint that it\\'s located in Louisiana and has always been located in Louisiana. And furthermore, if it isn\\'t, that the change is made in the thalweg have no effect on our eastern boundary. That\\'s the first issue. Then the second is whether this thing is caused by avulsion or pure accretion? Is it a gradual and imperceptible thing? Or is it something that you can see or the change is personable? Or is it done in such a manner that this artificial change resulted in no change in boundary? Now, I -- I think that it\\'s quite an important point, if this thing is avulsive, we have the additional issue, which I was beginning to get into, of when is the critical date? If it was avulsive, is it when the channel is completed? Or is it when it becomes completely effective? Or is it when we have drilled our oil well? All of these are important questions and we\\'ll come up. They will determine the good or the bad faith of the oil company in drilling this well. Should they have known or not know whether to drill this well? We -- we think that all these questions will have to be decided. We think that counsel for the opposition is talking either both sides of his mouth. First in his brief, he says, “All you\\'ve got to do is find the present thalweg. You don\\'t have to take jurisdiction over this matter. (Inaudible) and you\\'ll find. On other hand, he is saying, “If you take jurisdiction over this case, you\\'re going to be faced with a multiplicity of suits, it\\'s so complex, it\\'s going to be too troublesome for this Court.” Now, I think that that\\'s an inconsistent argument that is made by our opponent. We do not think that it would be too difficult for this Court or any other court to decide. We simply feel that the United States Constitution has set up this Court as the original forum for such a dispute. <Hugo L. Black>  May you read your complaint as charging that the change or the shift is viewed to accretion coming onto the side of the river, which accretions were caused by man-made work at the bar? <Edward M. Carmouche>  We were trying to do that in one other thing. We were trying to plead alternatively that first, this is an avulsion and it done map because the boundary was set. Second, if it was not an avulsion that these accretions were not gradual and imperceptible and therefore, they would not -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  In (Inaudible) -- where the Court find. <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, sir -- <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  If that what was avulsive. <Edward M. Carmouche>  That\\'s right. <William J. Brennan, Jr.>  And with the cutoff, isn\\'t it? <Edward M. Carmouche>  That\\'s right. <Hugo L. Black>  And that\\'s -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Now -- <Hugo L. Black>  That\\'s the -- the difference in legal course you and your adversary. <Edward M. Carmouche>  Yes, Your Honor. <Hugo L. Black>  They asked us to either expand or (Inaudible) with case or simply hold that the language there were would apply to accretions caused by man-made avulsions and you say that -- that language in that opinion should not be so construed unless you -- <Edward M. Carmouche>  Correct, Your Honor. <Hugo L. Black>  -- could so find. <Edward M. Carmouche>  In other words, the question that Your Honor asked to my opponent, “Show me a case where an avulsion -- that -- that after an avulsion that the title was determined by the live thalweg.” I have been unable to find any case that this Court has ever decided to that effect. The cases that my opponents have pointed out dealt with pure accretion. They did not deal with avulsive situation. And we think the fact that this is immediately below a cutoff makes it nonetheless, avulsive. So therefore, I believe that we have shown all of their arguments that there is a justiciable controversy, that we have stated the cause of action. There is a real dispute between the State of Louisiana and Mississippi. In closing, I would like to counteract one thing my opponent has said and that is if they had no knowledge of this complaint until they saw it, I think we can aptly show before our Master that we wrote the Attorney General of Mississippi and the Governor of Mississippi stating that we were going to the seek the original-jurisdiction of this Court more than two months prior to its filing. They were aware of this dispute. I\\'d like to finish by talking about this agreement between Humble and Carter and the Zuccaros, which I thought has made so much of the seeking agreement. I do not believe that the State of Louisiana\\'s right can be modified in any respect by either Carter, by Humble or by the Zuccaros nor can the rights of the State of Mississippi is purely immaterial to the matter at hand. The question is, is there a dispute? Is it a real dispute? We say it is real and immediate. I certainly want to thank the Court for your kind attention. It\\'s been a real privilege. <Earl Warren>  Yes.'"
