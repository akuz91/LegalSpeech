Steps for Audio Splitting:
Goals: Get mp3 files in GCP, convert to FLAC with sox, split with sox and store in GCP

(Local) gcloud sdk install
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-8qFh8EfFA
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install 

(GCP) Create a Project
(Local) Configure project to terminal 
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

(Local) converted mp3 to falc with sox (pip install sox)
sox -G 19-309.mp3 --channels=1 --bits=16 --rate=16000 output19-309.flac

(Manually) put it in gcp storage bucket

(GCP) Initialize GCP Env
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/media-entertainment/optimizing-audio-files-for-speech-to-text#initializing_your_environment 

(Local) split into multiple flac files
sox -V3 output19-309.flac  output.flac silence 1 3.0 0.1% 1 0.3 0.1% : newfile : restart

(to call API Locally, but I suspect you need it to run API in GCP as well) Create Service Key
https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/libraries#setting_up_authentication 
Search "APIs & Services" in Google Console 
Go to credentials

(to call API Locally, but I suspect you need it to run API in GCP as well)  Enable API for the project
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/speech.googleapis.com?project=audio-splitting-10-6 

(Locally) Transcribe in ipython (open python tab)
https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/libraries#using_the_client_library 
** Code: https://github.com/googleapis/python-speech/blob/master/samples/snippets/quickstart.py 
Change line 43 LINEAR16 -> FLAC

(MUST MUST MUST DO!!!!!!) Shut down project (in project settings), disable API, delete service key, delete storage buckets
