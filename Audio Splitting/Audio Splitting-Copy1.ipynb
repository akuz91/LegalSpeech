And prior to 2004, many courts in D.C. had awarded punitive damages in cases under the Flatow Amendment.\",\n",

       "   \"It instead gave the President waiver authority solely with respect to Iraq. It demonstrates that the President knew that this statute provided for punitive damages to apply retroactively, and Congress's reaction to that was to say yes, we want -- we want punitive damages here to apply retroactively. An additional point I would make that's related is that under the Flatow Amendment, ever since its enactment in 1996, it had always been applied to allow for punitive damages for past acts of terrorism, including in the case involving Lisa Flatow herself. There is just no reason to think that Congress in 2008 wanted to narrow the relief that had been available under the Flatow Amendment.\",\n",
       "   \"This was instead, if you look at the history of how Congress has dealt with the terrorism exception going back to 1996, it is consistently an effort to expand, not always perfectly effective effort, but it's an effort to expand the relief available to victims of terrorism. There's no reason to think that after enacting the Flatow Amendment and providing punitive damages that looked backwards, that now Congress would provide a different punitive damages remedy that looked only forward. It also, of course, would ignore the acts of terrorism that were most in Congress's mind at the time, which included, of course, this bombing here. One additional point I could make that further demonstrates that this would apply retroactively is the operation of the related actions provision.\",\n",
       "   'And as the D.C. Circuit recognized in an opinion by then Judge Kavanaugh, the -- that related actions provision allows a person who already has a judgment for compensatory damages to file a new action under the new federal cause of action to seek punitive damages.

So you have the text of the statute, the history of the statute, and the context in which it arose, all here together, work -- work together to persuasively demonstrate that Congress wanted punitive damages to apply to past acts of terrorism.
